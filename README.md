[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d5115e1b-a5eb-4a0c-93c1-3719da849490/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/shortis/deploys)

A personal website, using 11ty, and hosted on Netlify.

No client JavaScript at all, no CSS pre-processor.

## Why the move away from Gatsby?

I wanted to deliver zero JavaScript to the client and make the lightest, fasted and most accessible site possible. I didn't find Gatsby to be a good fit for that.

11ty provided the tools I needed for good DX while allowing me to keep control of the output (and actually see it).

I don't necessarily dislike React, but using it along with GraphQL to build a lightweight personal website is extremely heavy handed. I will continue to use these tools for large projects that need dynamic data at scale. This site doesn't need it; it just gets in the way of delivery.
