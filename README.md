# short.is

A personal website, written with Next.js, styled-components, and Web Components.

## A note on code quality

This project is maintained by one person, so is not a great example of how to write well documented and scalable code. There is no linting, no JSDoc comments or prop types, very minimal commenting and no tests.

The focus is primarily on performance and accessibility, and how React as a development approach doesn't have to mean delivering a large amount of JavaScript to users.
