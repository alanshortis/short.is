        <p class="large">I’m Alan Shortis—a front end developer based in Nottingham. I like CSS more than JavaScript, aesthetics more than data, design systems more than chaos, and accessibility more than exclusion.</p>
        <p>As a front end developer, I specialise in developing user interfaces in HTML and CSS. But, it being {{ site.year }}, I also work extensively in JavaScript, using React on a daily basis partnered with GraphQL and Node.</p>
        <p>I have been a developer profressionally in some capacity for more than 10 years, though I made my first websites in the late 90s. They were terrible, even by the standards of Geocities.</p>
        <p>My preference for front end development is likely connected to me being a design hobbyist who used the internet to show off derivative ideas. Across my career I have also worked with Classic ASP, .net, PHP, and SQL in my brief time as an analyst, but building user interfaces for people is where I have settled.</p>
