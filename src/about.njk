        <p class="large">I’m Alan Shortis—a front end developer based in Nottingham. I like CSS more than JavaScript, design systems more than chaos, and accessibility more than exclusion.</p>
        <p>As a front end developer, I specialise in building user interfaces with HTML and CSS. But, it being {{ site.year }}, I also work extensively in JavaScript, using React on a daily basis partnered with GraphQL and Node.</p>
        <p>I have been a developer professionally in some capacity for more than 10 years, though I made my first websites in the late 90s. They were terrible, even by the standards of Geocities.</p>
        <p>My preference for front end development is likely connected to me being a design hobbyist who used the internet to show off derivative ideas. Across my career I have also worked with Classic ASP, .net, PHP, and SQL in my brief time as an analyst, but building accessible user interfaces for people is where I have settled.</p>
        <h2>Now</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Reading {{ goodreads | safe }}.</li>
          <li>Learning German.</li>
          <li>Watching Columbo.</li>
          <li>Learning JavaScript data structures and algorithms. Reluctantly.</li>
          <li>Ignoring any notion of 'training' and just trying to cycle as much as I can.</li>
          <li>Daydreaming about being able to travel again, while being simultaneously anxious about it.</li>
        </ul>
