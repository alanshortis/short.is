Being the third person in a remote team to get the same illness (can't keep food down, weak) has me feeling like an old-time disease paranoid who thought that sickness could be spread through smells and radio waves.

Next I'll be getting someone to walk in front of my car holding a red flag to warn the nervous public of the imminent arrival of my horseless carriage.
