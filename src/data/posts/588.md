It's said that the person who loves walking will walk further than the person who loves the destination.

I don't particularly enjoy writing code; I am more focussed on outcomes and the product being built than the syntax that enables it. I have worked with engineers who have the inverse of this opinion, and they are often more skilled than I am at writing code. It's the process that they love.

The balance between the two is the sweet spot.
