Bicycle rollers feel so unnatural. I understand how and why they work; the physics are identical to riding a bike outside. That lack of forward motion and a very limited width to ride within make it all so very strange.

It's no coincidence that cyclists with that perfect souplesse spent a lot of time on the track, and therefore a lot of time on rollers. That's the difference between riding a turbo trainer and riding rollers; in my very short stint riding track I became much more centred on the bike. It's not just about pedalling, it's about remaining upright.
