title: 'On food smells'
---

It doesn't matter what I eat, almost every day my neighbour cooks something that smells like the best thing anyone has ever eaten.

When I go to the effort, I can make some reasonable things but it never smells as good, and never has that depth of flavour. It's probably a skill issue, but I'm also convinced that food prepared by someone else always tastes better.
