I never watch golf. I can't really see the appeal. And while I can appreciate that it's very difficult, the huge scale and distances that the ball is being played makes it hard to appreciate the nuance.

Snooker should be very boring to watch but I can observe men dressed like butlers holding sticks for a very long time. Too long, let's say.
