New iPhone season again, and the part of me that was interested and excited about this every year is gone (even with my affinity for titanium). The updates are barely there; some imperceivable improvement with the camera, a better processor that makes a tiny difference. Even the headline update of USB-C charging is a bit of a shrug. I have no daily-charge items that use it, and I have plenty of lightening cables wherever I need them.

Phones and laptops are disposable items that won't last forever. Even if you keep hold of a phone for a while, it will eventually be obsolete.

That annual itch to get the latest and greatest phone has been replaced with a desire to pick up things that are endlessly repairable, ideally don't need batteries, and if they ever die their parts are recyclable.
