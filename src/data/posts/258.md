Cycling is extremely unique in that the great, famous venues can be ridden by anyone fit enough to get there. If you loved seeing Armstrong and Pantani battling on Mont Ventoux, you can ride it. Boonen and Cancellara dominating on the cobbles and celebrating in the Roubaix velodrome? They're both free to ride.

You can't go and play football at Wembley, Tennis at Wimbledon or Snooker at The Crucible.
