Working from home is consistent. Removal of commute and familiar surroundings entirely in my control is a great thing that I would not be willing to give up at this point.

If working at home is a comfortable 'middle', office work is on the extreme in both directions. There is nothing quite as powerful as thrashing out a problem with other people in person. A shared physical white board and exposure to their body language and tone of voice can be invaluable. There is also nothing quite as soul crushing as sitting in a room with other people who are not working on the same thing, are all wearing headphones, and are all dreading the commute.
