I miss London. Being here occasionally for work exposes me to trace amounts of hustle and some level of bustle that reminds me why I like this stupid city.

I would have to give up my car, either not having one at all or replacing it for something that isn't subject to the emissions surcharge. It's an impossible situation, because replacing it would push me over budget and not having one at all would eliminate a lot my my current freedom and enjoyment. I love driving, and I don't want to not have that.

Maybe, like New York, I have just aged beyond the point that it's a fun place to live on a regular salary. You need to be young and ready to accept some discomfort in exchange for all that the city has to offer, or you need to have money. I fit neither criteria.
