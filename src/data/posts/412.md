There aren't a lot of photographers who inspire me, or create images that make me want to pick up my camera and emulate what they've done. But here's some who do:

- **[Ernst Haas'](https://ernst-haas.com/color-new-york/)** colour and composition feels absolutely unattainable. New York. Leica. 1950s. It's exquisite.
- **[Gregory Crewdson](https://www.artnet.com/artists/gregory-crewdson/)** doesn't always actually take the photo. So much of his work is a huge production that takes a team of people to create, but the resulting image looks like a single moment in a cinematic universe.
- **[Joel Meyerowitz](https://www.joelmeyerowitz.com/aftermath).** Like a more zoomed in Haas, capturing more of the human element than the city surrounding them. His work in the aftermath of 9/11 is astounding. More New York, more Leica.
- **[Stephen Shore](http://stephenshore.net/photographs/uncommon)**. Pure Americana, on large format film.
