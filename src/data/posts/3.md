I don't understand why IKEA makes it harder to buy their products. If I had to describe their delivery service in one word, it would be 'reluctant'. Expensive and very slow, and clearly designed to make you go to the store yourself. I like going to IKEA because of hotdogs, but I also can't fit a sofa in my car and my tolerance for _loose_ children is low.

They could make a fortune by opening an online store for all the homeware that is crammed into the market hall. Fast and cheap delivery of things like lighting, mirrors, kitchenware, and soft furnishings would surely be relatively easy to set up and hugely lucrative. Throw in the meatballs and cinnamon buns and they'll sell everything anyone needs.
