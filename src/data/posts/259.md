I once worked with someone who would loudly claim that all meetings were a waste of their time, but also complain that 'management' hadn't done a good enough job of communicating what they need and what the goal is.

I used to lean more towards the opinion that meetings are generally valuable enough to have even if they're largely hard going. But recently I have found them to be absolutely soul crushing.

I have started to maintain a todo list of tasks that are very low effort that I can tackle during low-participation meetings. I'm in a meeting right now.
