My current passport photo looks like me. Even with it being taken a few weeks before COVID hit, so it doesn't quite show the horror and trauma and take aways.

When I first started to travel to the USA fairly regularly in my early 20s I was on the last few years of a passport that was issued when I had just turned 16. The printed phyisical photo stuck under some clear film in a passport that already looks vintage was that of a boy wearing a bright green shirt.
