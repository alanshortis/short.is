I recognise just how lucky I am to be able to travel more than once a year, but that feeling of returning and having a long stretch of work and mundanity, unbroken for a long period, is a bit of a downer.

The planning and anticipation is all part of the enjoyment, though it's probably too early to be looking at the weather for Wyoming and Colorado.
