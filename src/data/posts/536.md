title: 'On dark mode'
---

We have dark mode for websites and apps. Let's extend it:

- **Books.** I'd absolutely read a physical book printed white on black
- **Album covers.** OK, this one is a bit weird but when driving at night the album art appears on my car's screen. When it's [Scaring the Hoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaring_the_Hoes) the brightness is a little distracting. Don't make me change settings, just give me a dark mode album cover. Bonus benefit: two covers for physical copies, more copies sold to collectors. Admittedly not good for photographic album art
- **Hotel room.** Zaha Hadid already [kind of did this one](https://www.zaha-hadid.com/design/hotel-puerta-america/)
