Large-ish meeting today, and I manage to launch into a bit of a rant. In the moment I believed everything I said, but moments after hanging up I begin the process of reliving some especially dumb things I said.

The loose opinions were aired among some actually good ideas and suggestions, allowing me to compound the fear and self reflection even further.
