What make a record store good? I visited a place in Sheffield today that absolutely looked the part, and while I left with a few items I didn't really feel like I would go back.

The selection was what-they-had rather than anything particularly curated. No new releases, and some of the less-popular releases from very well known bands.

I have to own up to a lot of this being a me problem though. I don't have the desire to dig through every shelf like I used to, and I don't have the keen eye of a more seasoned collector.

I picked up Curtis Mayfield, De La Soul, and Tom Waits.
