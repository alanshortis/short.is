OK, Welding. Not really a hobby, but an idea for my post-software engineering life. As usual, not making things easy for myself.

I really like the idea of building steel or titanium bike frames. Materials that are hard to work with and becoming less and less popular as high end road bikes become more and more complex is a classic example of me making things more complex than they need to be.

The more likely reality is asking a farmer if they need a website after I have welded a gate back together.
