Radiohead - Weird Fishes/Arpeggi comes on while driving, and once home I have to google what the difference is between an Arpeggio and an Ostinato.

Through the drum exams I managed to complete, there was a good amount of theory and a need to learn various Italian words. But as an Arpeggio is a repetition of notes that constitute a chord, this isn't something possible in untuned percussion.

You can't really do [Glissando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glissando), either, but I like the word.
