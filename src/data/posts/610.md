Mere minutes of YouTube scrolling, looking for tips on maximising airline status opportunities, reveals a whole group of people whose tourism consists of flights and airport lounges, with the destination being only a side effect of where gets the most points.

This doesn't sounds as weird to me as it might have at some point. If the flights are for status, they're going to be in the more premium cabins. Those cabins come with lounges, and both the plane the lounge are places to relax while someone brings you good food at no extra cost.

You can pay a lot to have that beside a pool, but maybe you don't like pools and would rather be at altitude.
