Only Fools and Horses was exceptionally popular in my house when I was a kid. The run of episodes in the early 90s with (what should have been) the finale in 1996 was pretty perfect.

I have been watching some again recently, and the amount of jokes I didn't get in my early teens that now land is absurd.

The best episode, Stage Fright, involves a club singer who cannot pronounce 'R'. This detail isn't revealed until very late in the episode, long after the character is in a long scene and has already sung on screen ('if a song has an R in it change the lywics'). To write it in a way where he doesn't use any words that give the game away is a special kind of genius.
