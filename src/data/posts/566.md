title: 'On front page of a website'
---

For a pointless website like this one, where no vital information is being shared and no one visiting is to be converted into a customer, why does the front page even have to have anything on it?

Book and album covers are reserved for some kind of art or design that hopefully represents what's inside, but not a summary of the contents.

The front page of this site is dreadful. It serves no purpose and was made in a hurry. But I also don't want to have the boilerplate intro to who I am and what I do, only to then need to repeat that on a more complete 'about' page. Maybe it's time to recycle some bullshit I have made in codepen, meaningless shapes made with CSS, and put them front and centre. Hopefully that will be enough to make people leave.
