Past neighbours who maybe had habit:

- Upstairs neighbour who would practice her slam poetry loudly. A bit of a Kae Tempest thing. Not bad.
- A band who did a sort of Black Sabbath/Sleep/Weedeater thing. The aroma that came from their warehouse unit was absolutely pungent and appropriate for the music. Not bad.
- A painter. Think Tony Hancock in [The Rebel](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rebel_(1961_film)>). Bad.
