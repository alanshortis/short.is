title: 'On interviewing'

I have been interview potential new candidates at work recently, and it's pretty fascinating. It's the same technical test I had to complete for my interview, so every single time it's a trip down memory lane to one of the most stressful interviews I've ever done. I literally asked to start over about half way thorough. It worked out in the end.

Maybe this will make me better in interviews as the candidate when it's time to move on. Something so many people do it talk to fill time, rather than actually saying anything of value. It's like a filibuster, running out the clock to technically 'pass' the interview.
