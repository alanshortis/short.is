In looking back before writing about resolutions, I found what I said I'd do last year. You may be shocked to hear that I have done fucking none of them.

In some light reflection of the last year (with a couple of weeks to go) I know that I feel better. There is some optimism in my days; even those days where it's fairly slight, it's a far cry from the end of 2022 where things felt genuinely hopeless.
