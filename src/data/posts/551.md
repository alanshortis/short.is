title: 'On aspirational intelligence'

My particular brand of intelligence is aspirational. I own books by Jung and Dostoyevsky because I have heard enough about the subject matter to know that there is a lot of learn by reading them.

But when it comes to actually reading and comprehending the text? That's where things fall apart. Brothers Karamazov is a thick as a house brick, and the idea of tackling it makes me feel even thicker than that.
