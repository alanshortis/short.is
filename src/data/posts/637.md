**ATP verses The Fans, Minehead, [18th-20th May 2007](https://concerts.fandom.com/wiki/All_Tomorrow%27s_Parties_vs_the_Fans_2007), Â£120**

I cannot describe how insane the line up of this festival was.

Shellac (twice), Isis, Battles, Mogwai, Patty Smith, Yo La Tengo, Subtitle, Subtle, Edan, Why?, Ghost, Slint, Battles, Do Make Say Think.

There were more. I wasn't into them at the time. But every one of the above bands blew me away, and with Albini now gone I'm extra grateful to have to seen Shellac twice.

Isis were incredibly heavy. Members of countless other bands were at the side of the stage to watch Battles somehow pull off their music live. Edan beat juggling while holding a mic and freestyling. Watcing Do Make Say Think from the back of the room, every song coming together like a painting, while I drank too much whiskey surrounded by some of the nicest, most respectful and relaxed people I've ever met.

Personal drama played a part both before and during the weekend. I was sad for a lot of it, but that somehow enhanced the experience, as cliched as that sounds.
