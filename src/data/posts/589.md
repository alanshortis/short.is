Photos and pieces of music might be made at different times but get published together, in an album or a photo book. Getting continuity between everything, maybe in sound, colour, contrast and feel, is difficult to achieve.

In some recent photos, changeable light and camera settings made everything look just a little separate despite all depicting time and space in close proximity. I didn't really want to fall into the preset trap, but I do want to make the photos look like they belong.
