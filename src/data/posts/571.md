Frequency illusion, also known as the Baader Meinhof phenomenon, is the phenomenon where something you've just noticed, experienced or been told about suddenly crops up constantly. It gives the illusion that it's come out of nowhere, but it's actually always been there. It's just that you've never noticed it before.
