I cannot choose an actual favourite TV show of all time. There are the big names that get dropped constantly (The Sopranos, The Wire) and while I really love them, they don't have that special something that [Atlanta](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_(TV_series)>) has.

Four seasons of relatively short, mostly funny but occasionally poignant shows. Usually episodic, but occasionally we drop out of the main story and get a standalone short film that is completely unrelated. This same trick is also used in [Master of None](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_None), and I really love how an established show and platform can be used to create and distribute these short films that might otherwise never get made.

Also: I have said it before, but LaKeith Stanfield makes everything he appears in at least 10% beter.
