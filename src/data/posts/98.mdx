title: 'On knowing when to quit'
---

Clear blue skies and perfect weather are a rare thing in Wales. Rare enough to take a last minute day off work and be a few miles into a walk before the sun rises. Cold enough to see mist hanging low over lakes and forests but warm enough to not need a jacket.

Also a good day for knowing when to quit. A tough scramble over very wet rocks was too much for me today, and I made the call to climb back down and walk an alternate route. Being out there alone and having not told anyone where I was was enough risk for one day.

The thing about bodies is that they're soft and easy to damage.
