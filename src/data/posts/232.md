Email bad! Here is a tool that can bombard you with messages that you don't really care about all day, and also make the ones you do care about harder to find. You might be added to a group that gets tagged and that means you'll get tagged and notified even if you don't really care. And you might join a more social channel for a subject that you would ordinarily enjoy but will quickly grow tired of. Don't worry though, you can leave any channel at any time and we'll let everyone on that channel know that you left and we'll add you back into the channel if someone mentions you.
