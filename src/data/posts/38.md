By passing through railway stations and airports, I have had some kind of man-made structure over my head all the way from Nottingham to Newark. That's Newark in New Jersey, not Newark Nottinghamshire. And Jersey USA, not the channel island. On the way to New York. Not York in Yorkshire.

I guess the early settlers liked their place names.
