I never used to feel as if work is a waste of life-time. Where so much time and effort goes into a job and making someone else's (an individual or a board) ideas and dreams a reality.

This is how it works. Those people who seem to be endlessly travelling are both very much to be in that position but they're also only sharing the highlight reels while we are forced to see the behind-the-scenes in every detail.
