There is a horrific ad playing during the F1 coverage. Paul Stanley, Ozzy Osbourne, Joan Jett and Billy Idol angrily request that people who work in corporate settings stop calling each other Rock Stars.

Because nothing says Rock Star more than getting paid to advertise a corporate HR tool. Isn't a 9 figure net worth from fronting a truly seminal band enough for Ozzy? He needs to defame himself even further?
