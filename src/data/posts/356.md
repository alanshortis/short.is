Spending my own money makes me feel guilty. I go through cycles of trying to sell as much of my stuff that I don't use as possible, looking around the house at all the STUFF I have bought over the years. From furniture (essential) to books and music I have either never read or listened to, or haven't for years.

At one time these purchases all made sense, but right now I'd just like it all to be gone. It feels heavy, or like a roof rack on a car causing drag and ruining fuel economy.
