**Saul Williams, The Scala, London, [3rd May 2005](https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/saul-williams/2005/scala-london-england-4ba76fbe.html)**

The Scala being small was accentuated with two facts about this show. Saul opted to not use a microphone for some of the spoken word parts (though he seemed keen for people to shut up faster than they did), and an extremely tall man with a long neck positioned himself directly in front of the stage for the whole show.

I managed to get my camera in, so there is a short [clip on YouTube](https://youtu.be/g1uxwr4yv_8?si=FVGRbzqaLncREFVs).
