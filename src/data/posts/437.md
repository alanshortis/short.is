When I started at HMV in 2003 (20 years ago somehow) someone had a home made sticker on their discman (yes, 2003) that said 'Jimi Hendrix is shit'.

There is a theory that your taste in music is set by the time you're 24, and I was still with HMV all the way up to 28 years old, so that exposure to so much new music and diverse opinion among my colleagues might skew things, but I think that theory is nonsense.

In recent years I have got far more comfortable with classical and jazz, and far less interested in classic rock and indie. My old repulsion to the home made sticker has been surpassed with feeling that... maybe he had a point.
