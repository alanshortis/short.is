There was a period for me where music with the most notes crammed into the smallest space was the mark of something that was really special. I still like that, but to call on a tired cliche, it's the space between the notes that makes me feel things now.

In [American Symphony](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Symphony_(film)>) Jon Batiste dedicates a piece of music to his wife, Suleika Jaouad, who was battling lukemia at the time. In between the dedication and starting to play he leaves a pause that feels as if it'll never end. It says more than any note could.

Silence in music was probably most famously explored by John Cage in his piece [4'33"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%E2%80%B233%E2%80%B3), though for me this was always more of a conceptual piece lacking any context for the silence. With Batiste's piece, the silence is heartbreaking.
