I revived and updated my [setlist.fm](https://www.setlist.fm/user/alanshortis) account. The headline stat is 158 bands/artists at 226 concerts. The more surprising discoveries are that I have managed to see The Who twice without trying, been to Brixton Academy 12 times, and the worst venue in the world (Wembley arena) 7.

But the most glaring issue is that from 2001 to the middle of 2011 I went to many concerts every year. And then it stops dead, with only 6 shows in total since. That change of pace aligns exactly with moving away from Nottingham and the beginning of my 10 year quest to be with someone. To find my person while ignoring myself.

Funny how these changes of mindset can appear in otherwise unrelated statistics.
