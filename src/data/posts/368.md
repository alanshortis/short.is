> Probably spoilers for Ad Astra

I read something today about films where nothing happens, and Ad Astra was mentioned a few times. As slow films about nothing in particular are my favourite, I put it on.

About 10 minutes in, they mention an astronaut is missing and they then show some photos of Tommy Lee Jones. Safe to assume they'll find him then.
