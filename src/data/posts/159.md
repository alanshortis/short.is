title: 'On simplification'

Time to simplify. This is a glorified blog, and the ~writing~ section is ultimately absolutely useless. Nothing there is particularly groundbreaking, nothing there is particularly complex or in need of my input or explanation, and nothing there gets looked at very often.

What it does do, however, is make the entire build of this site much more complex and less portable. The technical posts use MDX which ties me to React, whereas straight up markdown can be rendered pretty much anywhere.

I also really need to finally add a photography section. Much like the daily writing, having photos posted and public and not just hidden away in some private repository is going to motivate me to edit what I have and create something new.
