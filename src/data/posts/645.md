I don't particularly wan't to vote Labour, but I will to get he tories out. There is no denying that the conservative party is filled with evil ghouls who do not deserve to be anywhere near power, and while Labour are absolutely an improvement, they still don't really represent me.

My concern is that this apathy and complacency will lead to a conservative victory. Voter turnout will be low, and a lot of people would rather abstain than vote for the better of two bad options.
