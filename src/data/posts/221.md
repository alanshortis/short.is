Film has a distinct quality over digital images. Grain and colour characteristics are a side effect of the technology but become the selling point. With the ocean of presets and film simulations in Lighroom and built into some cameras (that are often styled to look like film rangefinders) that gap is getting smaller. But it's an interesting point that a lot of what makes the look so appealing wasn't deliberate and yet is added back in later.

Vinyl has a distinct quality over digital audio. A slight crackle and complete lack of loss are a side effect of the technology but become the selling point. But streaming services have never really attempted to emulate those characteristics. They could add a dusty sound to the audio, but that's only really done as a deliberate affect.
