title: 'On taking blood'

Getting enough blood out of my arm for a routine test took the combined effort of two nurses and a doctor. With an arm like a pin cushion, I was told that I clot extremely quickly. Almost as if I want to keep my blood.

The winning move was drinking a glass of water and doing a few push-ups. While I don't have a problem with needles, I do have a problem with demonstrating how weak I am in front of medical professionals.
