While we are extremely lucky to have the NHS, for the soonest appointment available for a non-urgent issue being 2 months away, and that appointment potentially leading to joining a waiting list of two years, is pretty unacceptable.

With the alternative being huge insurance companies and a cancer diagnosis leading to bankruptcy, I'll just try and take better care of myself and hope to not need it.
