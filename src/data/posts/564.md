The cycling road season may start in Australia in January, but for me it's not really happening until we get to Europe. Specifically, Italy and Strada Bianca. Gravel roads ('white roads') and a now-iconic finish in Siena. It's not a monument but it's become as notable as Flanders and Roubaix.

Moreover, it's the point of the year where I have to accept that the opportunity to train over winter and be ready for the road in the warm spring months has been missed yet again.

Where dominance absolutely ruins F1, I love to see the best stay the best in cycling.
