title: 'On selling it all'

During a long work meeting I did a rough post-it note estimate of how much money I could net if I sold everything I own. It's worth noting that I don't own a house and my car was three grand nearly two years ago.

The result? I can't retire just yet. But I could buy one flexible first class ticket to somewhere very far away. One way. So I wouldn't need all that crap when I get there anyway.

Tempting.
