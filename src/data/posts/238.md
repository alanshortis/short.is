The 'New York is like nowhere else' or 'only in New York' rhetoric is irritating.

When I used Instagram I followed a couple of accounts that would post good restaurants and bars in the cities, but but they would also post strings of things that they would claim only New Yorkers would understand. Every one of them was a big city thing, not a New York thing. They might have been framed by specific locations but swap for anywhere in Paris and it's the same story.
