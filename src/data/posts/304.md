Water is not wet. It's water. Put some water on the floor, and the floor is wet. Put water on water, you have more water.

(The notion of separate collections of water being merged and become one bigger body of water got to me thinking about the idea that us being separate people and having separate experiences is all an illusion... But I don't have the smarts or eloquence to put that into words.)
