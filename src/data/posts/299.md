There are two noticeable sets of people on twitter that really grind my gears:

- **Anti-intellectualism**: Actively against people who are experts or have spent years in their field. Some might also think that people who like particular music, films, or books are snobs and only claim to enjoy those things for show or to appear smarter than they really are.

- **I'm smarter than you and I need you to know it**: I saw a series of threads today that were titled 'stupid people's idea of a smart person', which included high profile podcast hosts and popular non-fiction authors. A sea of people who are definitely super smart cherry pick examples to back up their generalisation.

Opposite ends of the same shitty argument.
