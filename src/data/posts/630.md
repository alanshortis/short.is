**Cinematic Orchestra, Barbican Hall, London, [6th May 2007](https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/the-cinematic-orchestra/2007/barbican-centre-london-england-63dae2af.html)**

Barbican Hall is maybe the finest venue in London, with large comfy seats and perfect acoustics. Even with the room being as large as it is, every performance I have seen there has felt intimate.

This was long enough ago for memory to be very faded (this is going to be a theme in these posts) but I remember the quality of every song, with the musicianship and the production being flawless. However, I cannot stand their most popular song 'To Build a Home' so I was squirming in my (large and comfy) seat by the time it came around.
