Another hobby idea that I haven't even attempted: Pen plotting.

I'd like to use code to generate some one off geometric designs, then feed them to the pen plotter to draw them. One of the things I struggle with with code-as-creativity is that it's not tactile. Even the most elaborate canvas-based generative art still only exists as magnetism in a bunker owned by Jeff Bezos. This gets me to a physical object while bypassing my lack of drawing skills.
