Moral panic around social media isn't new but I think it might be different.

Socrates thought that writing would make people forgetful and lazy. Lenny Bruce was arrested for obscenity, telling jokes that are extremely tame by today's standards. Elvis Presley's hips were considered too sexual for television. TV was going to rot your brain. Video games were going to make you violent.

All of these turned out to be false, but social media might be different. It's ubiquitous, it's addictive, it's designed to keep you engaged, and it's aimed at children who can bully and be bullied in a virtual world with little to no consequences.
