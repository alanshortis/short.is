title: 'On swimming thing'

Sarah and I were together for a little over 4 years, and that was more than enough time to develop in jokes and vernacular that was nonsense to others. There was a dumb pet name that was used in both directions, which she let slip in front of a friend once, to a lot of laughter.

When I was learning to swim I would cry my eyes out in the car all the way there and beg my mother not to go. I'd do anything to avoid it. But, once in the pool I had a great time.

That aversion has carried forward into adulthood; cancelling social plans is like heroin but just like the pool, once I am out I feel good and I know it's what I needed.

When I'd complain before anything social all Sarah had to say was 'swimming thing'. Code for 'shut the fuck up and go'. And she was right. She was often right.
