title: 'On Mardi Gras'

It's not pancake day. It's fat Tuesday, and Mardi Gras in New Orleans.

As I have every Shrove Tuesday for many years, I'll listen to the likes of Professor Longhair, Dr. John, Trombone Shorty, Galactic, Jessie Hill, and so many more. All from one medium-sized city in Louisiana. This year it's [Donald Harrison](https://open.spotify.com/album/12uyCPV5xO0MALiUxdd0V0?si=fpGG83KlTaiOnIUONjaa-w) in particular.

Despite the adoration for the music, [Treme](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treme_(TV_series)>) rating well within my top 5 TV shows, having read more than one book about the cause and aftermath of Katrina, and visiting the USA close to 15 times, I have never managed to visit.

I have a year to get my shit together and make plans. Let's check in on day 553.
