title: 'On Alex Webb'

I don't have a large collection of photo books, but it's gradually growing. Ignoring my regret at selling several Gregory Crewdson books to pay bills (being flat broke was not my favourite), I have gradually got hold of collections from the likes of Ernst Haas and Stephen Shore, and most recently Alex Webb.

Alex Webb was not someone I'd heard of, but I stumbled upon an [article on Magnum](https://www.magnumphotos.com/theory-and-practice/brooklyn-the-city-within-alex-webb-rebecca-norris-webb-new-york-street-photography/). Not a shock that these images are from Brooklyn (I am aware that my weird thing for New York is kind of pathetic), the subject is probably a little beyond what I'd like to capture myself but the composition is incredible.

When I am in an unfamiliar place I see things to shoot all the time. When I am in my home town, that familiarity makes everything disappear in to static. I never carry my camera. And not doing a thing is a surefire way to never get better.
