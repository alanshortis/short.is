title: 'On hotel rooms'

You simply cannot think about what a hotel room actually is if you ever want to enjoy staying in hotels again. There was a different body in that bed the night before. They might have been affected by the local food in a way that led to enhanced bathroom time. They washed it off in that same shower. They touched that TV remote god knows how long after the last time they washed their hands. I'm sure sheets are washed to within an inch of their life, but what about the duvet itself? How many nights does a mattress last? Did they drop half their room service order? How much columbian has been chopped up on that tasteful glass table?

New business idea: Single use hotel. controlled demolition of the entire building every day at 3pm. New hotels are being built simultaneously. We're improving cleanliness and creating jobs.
