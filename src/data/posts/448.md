Seeing what other people with the same job title as I have, and them clearly nailing it and solving difficult problems. Vs me spending too long thinking about colours and and pixel-pushing in CSS and very rarely reaching for any features of React beyond the most basic of hooks.

I need to get the side projects back in my life. Honestly, how long does it take to put some photography on this website?
