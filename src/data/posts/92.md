title: 'On best intentions'

Doing things to supposedly help with better sleep. A set time on the alarm clock (turn it off, reset it for an hour later). A timer on the lights so they switch off at 11, as a reminder to go to bed (turn them back on again). Check work calendar the night before to help prepare for the next day (immediately forget it all because memory is a myth in 2022).

Best intentions vs actually following through. I'm on the left of this balance right now.
