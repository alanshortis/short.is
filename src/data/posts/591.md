Seven random days off across the year, but I have opted out of them at work. This isn't giving up paid time off, it just adds those days to my holiday balance to use how I want.

If I had a family I'd think twice, and enjoy the days off. But as it is, it's better to have the flexibility. Though for a second I forgot that Christmas Day is technically a bank holiday.

When working for HMV, bank holidays were paid at double time. Some genius in payroll would add one day at double time to the pay of everyone that worked, apparently not realising that we were paid for that day anyway. It was an open secret that we were taking home triple time until someone put 2 and 2 together and were good enough with numbers to realise that it makes 4.
