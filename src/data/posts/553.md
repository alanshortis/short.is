title: 'On taxation and libertarianism'
---

Hardcore libertarians often argue that taxation is theft. That the need to pay tax being compulsory is a violation of their freedom and that payment for services should be opt-in. Use a road? Pay a toll. Need the police? Pay a fee.

Such an incredibly selfish and short-sighted view of the world. People less fortunate have to choose if they want to pay the fire brigade to put out their house fire or not. People who can't afford to pay for the police to investigate a crime against them have to just let it go. Meanwhile the rich pay for their own private security and fire services, feed into capitalism, and the cycle continues.

Freedom isn't really freedom if it's at the expense of others.
