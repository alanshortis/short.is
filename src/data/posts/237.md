title: 'On lost keys'

In my time working at McDonalds, at least once a week someone would need to dig through the bins to find someone's keys. They'd idly put them on the tray while eating, then dump the contents and only realise when walking to the car.

Find them, rinse the milkshake and ketchup off, and hand them back saying 'it happens all the time' to their disbelief.
