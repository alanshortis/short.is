title: 'On Luxury'

Luxury is a pretty meaningless word. Every new apartment complex is described as luxury. There is a day spa near me that brands itself as luxury while advertising their 2-for-1 discounts. Even a nearby care home.

What does it mean? What would made an unfurnished apartment not luxury? An out-house instead of a bathroom? A tin bath? A well?

Somehow Viennetta is marketed as some kind of luxury desert despite being the cheapest shit in the freezer.
