My now only remaining film camera is made entirely from plastic, including the lens that is extremely far from free of imperfections. The body leaks light, the back sometimes comes off if you don't use tape, and you keep track of how many photos you have taken by reading a printed number on the back of the film through a little red window.

It's a bit of a joke of a camera, but that square lo-fi look that the early days of instagram made its own didn't come from nowhere.

Some of my best photos were taken with this camera, having never metered, framed a shot, or focussed. You make your best guess for the right film, and then you rely on the film's latitude to get you out of trouble. Lean into the shit quality and embrace the aesthetic.
