**Beastie Boys - [To The 5 Boroughs](https://open.spotify.com/album/1yw6pIVYjbf9WoLiPkIPJv?si=HVPtfCd3RASTczeEtgvclg)**

I think most would agree that this is one of their weaker albums. But I can't bring myself to hate a love letter to New York City, with the towers defiantly appearing on the cover. It's beautifully packaged, with the gatefold revealing the Brooklyn bridge and all the lyrics printed, but the records themselves are cheap and thin.

I would have got this from HMV while working there, and I know we bumped it loudly in the stock room daily.
