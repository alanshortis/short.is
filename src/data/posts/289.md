Spotify notification. I don't get those. What's this. Let's open it. Oh, it's a supposed 'AI' DJ, complete with a DJ voice which is worryingly convincing. Very enthusiastic. Enough to make me wonder what the FUCK he's so happy about.

Is having a voice say 'aight imma throw things back to your summer jams' something we need? I know it's supposed to make me feel as if they care about my tastes, keep me engaged etc, but it just feels like a gimmick. A hurriedly launched feature to show they're still relevant in tech. I cannot see any intelligence; this is the same recommendation and history they've always had, repackaged.
