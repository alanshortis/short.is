**Beastie Boys - [Paul's Boutique](https://open.spotify.com/album/1kmyirVya5fRxdjsPFDM05?si=E28JqXdaSlCdfplZYuKPSQ)**

I have an original pressing, and it's in pretty good shape. I have no idea where it came from, but it smells like old records. It's cheap and thin but sounds alright. The entire album is a collage of samples, and in my opinion, surpasses Three Feet High and Rising; the other sample heavy album of the time.

I was lucky enough to be at the unveiling of the Beastie Boys Square sign at Ludlow and Rivington, where the cover image was taken. It looks barely anything like that anymore.
