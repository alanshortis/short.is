AI is not likely to take over your entire job, but it will make workflows pretty different. Here is a flow I suspect is already happening to a lot of people:

- Send email, save shared document, whatever
- Person B sees the paragraphs, can't be fucked to read it all, asks AI to summarise them into bullet points
