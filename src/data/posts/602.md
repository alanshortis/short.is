Another weekly series to help me not need to think about ideas quite as much: Ticket Tuesday. Until physical tickets sopped being issued I'd keep as many as possible. The ink is fading on some, but most have been in the same big envelope for twenty something years.

**Deerhunter, Heaven, London, [6th May 2010](https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/deerhunter/2010/heaven-london-england-43d1e3cf.html), Â£13.50**

There are two memories attached to this show that have nothing to do with and yet have affected my life an extreme amount.

This was election day, when the Tories toppled Labour and quickly set about dismantling the country. And, I attended this show with my at-the-time new girlfriend, and we'd go on to be together for a long time after.

They played maybe two songs I recognised (as a casual fan at best) and The Horrors were standing in front of us for most of the show.
