More than once I have bee eating at some diner or bar and someone has come in, not actually ordered but had exactly what they want bought to them. Staff address them by name, ask them how they are, and say 'see you tomorrow' when they leave.

I change barbers when they start to build a profile on me, though questioning over several haircuts. That kind of familiarity makes me feel a little uncomfortable, and 'myself' is my least favourite subject.
