Bikeshedding describes a disproportionate amount of time spent discussing something that is mostly inconsequential to a larger project. Like discussing the bike shed that will be beside a large and complex building.

It's definitely easier to talk about the simpler details than it is to tackle the big stuff. It feels like progress, and maybe it is in a minute and mostly empty way. Its completion isn't going to affect the workings of the wider project.
