The Tour de France is the ultimate tourism advert for France. Having never really looked at the Jura Mountains, I have now been googling the various cycling climbs, places to stay, and places nearby. Being so far east and so close to the Swiss border, there are French towns with very German names.

That blurred edge between EU nations really is wonderful. Back in 2019 while cycling near the borders of Luxembourg, Germany, and Belgium we cross an international border 7 times in 70 miles. Totally free passage, and yet the subtle differences from country to country were still there.

This, and a recent VAT bill for something I bought from a German retailer is keeping my Brexit anger alive.
