Planes. Mid-flight, I can't wait for it to be over. As soon as I'm off the plane, I can't wait to get back on.

I'm lucky enough to be in a position where I aim to have at least one flight booked at all times. Whether it's a short hop to somewhere in Europe or a more ambitious long-haul flight months in the future that I have yet to make proper plans for, just seeing the flight number in an app is good for me.
