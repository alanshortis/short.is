Cyclists wave at each other as they pass. So do bus drivers. And motorcyclists. A friend has a VW T5 van, and he told me that there is usually a wave between van owners too, but when some branding for his cycling club was put on the front the waves dried up. Apparently people mistook it for a tradesman van, and it seems they don't deserve a wave.

There is a limit to camaraderie.
