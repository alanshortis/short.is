title: 'On Treme'

A show very few people watched despite being from the makers of The Wire, Treme combines the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and the speculative disaster capitalism, the beating heart of the New Orleans music tradition, and struggling restaurants, all with a New York connection and a roster of musicians and cooks from the real world.

It's glorious. Please watch it.
