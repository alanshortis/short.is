My [2023](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6wJy7QwrVkpH81ZSkyk7ua?si=6c5a0038438e4a78) playlist (one track from every album I enjoyed) somehow weighs in at seven-and-a-half hours and 77 tracks. Which is nice, since I like 7. It starts with ambience and ends heavy, via jazz and hip-hop. Which sort of fits the way seasons sit across a year. Which is possibly the most pretentious thing I've ever written.

Picking one favourite album is both difficult and unfair, but [SCARING THE HOES](https://open.spotify.com/album/3u20OXh03DjCUzbf8XcGTq?si=2DsLlPH0S9mhKUbMdQKU9w) is beautiful chaos and I don't think I have skipped a single track on every listen.

It's notable that this is the first year with no appearances from MF DOOM. Aesop Rock has taken up the guest-spot role, with three appearances as well as is own album.
