title: 'On photo quality bellcurve'
---

A bellcurve can be mapped to all sorts of things. I think about complexity in code most often and how beginners just make things simple, intermediate people start to over complicate and use all the tools, and then experts simplify again.

My photography started with a Â£30 Holga camera whose charm came from being deliberately low-fidelity. If you can't focus, if you can't set the exposure, if you can't even see through the viewfinder, then you're probably not going miss the shot.

I might be in the middle now. High quality photos, making things as sharp as possible, looking for that perfect bokeh and exposure.

How long until the Leica is on the shelf and I'm holding the Holga again?
