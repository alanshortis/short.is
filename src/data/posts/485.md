Is there a term for design that is so showy and overbearing, it complete overshadows the content it's supposed to support? There is a genre of website that seeks attention from sites like [awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/) that are very impressive but so often I leave having never taken in what I am looking at.

In a similar style, in this announcement for the [AI Pin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th3vzKTE0O8) the presenters about colour, battery life, and using hand gestures before even once mentioning WHAT IT IS.

YouTube is failing me, but J. Peterman in Seinfeld saying 'For Godâ€™s sake, man, just tell me what the product is!' would be a good video to link to right now.
