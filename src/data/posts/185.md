It's expensive to be poor.

Bad credit means the highest rates on borrowing (assuming you can find a lender who'll go near you) and lowest on saving (assuming you're not living month to month).

Monthly rent is often more than the mortgage on the same property, but a bank will tell you you cannot afford it without throwing down a five-figure sum. Meanwhile, the landlord has their tenant pay off a mortgage on their behalf.

Older cars need more maintenance, use more fuel, cost more to tax, and are subject to tolls if you want to go close to London. If you live in or near a low emissions zone, you'll get far less than it's worth when trying to sell.

Having money makes choices that lead to more money easier to attain. It's all cyclical, which is why both wealth and poverty are often generational.
