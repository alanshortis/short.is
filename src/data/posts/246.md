title: 'On public speaking'
---

I had sweaty palms before needing to speak publicly today, so let's just be thankful I didn't just cut and paste some Eminem lyrics here.

Five minutes of uninterrupted speaking leaves me with a sore throat. Then I start thinking about having a sore throat and I start to rush. Then I become aware of rushing and slow down too much. Then I become hyper aware of repetition and hesitation, as if I'm on Just a Minute on Radio 4.

Being me is exhausting.
