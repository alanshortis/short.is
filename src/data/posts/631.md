Steve Albini died.

There aren't that many people in music that are truly good and ethical. It's a pretty gross industry in many respects, where labels get between artists and their fans to extract money, and huge artists who have been able to use their power and popularity to close that gap will release endless vinyl variants and charge utterly absurd prices for tickets to their shows.

When asked to produce Nirvana's third album, Steve agreed on the condition that he would be paid a flat fee and not accept royalties. He didn't want to be seen as taking advantage of the band's success. Some would see that ethical stand as 'losing' a huge amount of money, but he never believed he had any claim to it in the first place.
