**Battles - [EP C/B EP](https://open.spotify.com/album/53Qlt8TGpjxJypO2eE04RM?si=NwoHoRomR_iXmLIWAld9bQ)**

Before getting popular with Mirrored, Battles released a pair of EPs that are packaged together here. Released on Warp, it's high quality as you'd expect. I really enjoy this; it's before they added any vocals and a long time before half the band left. There is some chin-stroking pretentiousness to it, which as I have got older I have come to appreciate while also not feeling the need to pretend to like it when it's clearly an experiment that should have been left in the studio.
