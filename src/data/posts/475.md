The 9-5 office life was, in hindsight, no good for me. For years I went further, starting between 7 and 8 so that I could leave earlier and make the most of the day. Getting up earlier and getting to work and grinding it out is sold as the way most productive people work. I do not work this way.

Being able to get up later, have a slower morning, be online for a morning meeting around 10 before doing light work until lunch. After lunch, focussed work time until around 6. Dinner, watch a film or something, then work again from around 8pm until 10. Bed at around midnight.

Remote work lets me do this, office work does not. Being able to work when I feel more productive makes a huge difference to the quality and quantity of my output.
