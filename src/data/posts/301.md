I wasted around a week of work time by overthinking and over complicating something that was deceptively simple. I'm usually pretty good with finding a simple solution where it's easy to fall into over engineering, but by trying to solve a problem on my own I got the wrong end of the stick.

I'm extremely bad at asking for help, much to my detriment.
