title: 'On Letterboxd Ratings'

You cannot trust Letterboxd Ratings. Or ratings of any film, really. When i have finished watching something like Waynes World, it's an easy 5 stars. It's a perfect movie and I've loved it for a very, very long time.

But at the same time, anyone with any sense is also going to give Godfather Part II 5 stars. It's important, seminal, essential. And while these are both films, they are not at all comparable.

We need italic stars or something. Some way of saying 'this is five stars, but'.
