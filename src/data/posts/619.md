I'll use ancient Egypt as an example but you can apply a variation of this to pretty much any conspiracy theory.

People who cannot comprehend ancients devising slow and methodical techniques to carve stone and then throw endless human suffering at it to move it would rather decide that there must have been some kind of alien intervention or lost technology.

'If I can't understand something, it must be because the real answer is something NO ONE understands.'
