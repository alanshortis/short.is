**Book review:** [The Creative Act: A Way of Being](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60965426-the-creative-act), by Rick Rubin.

You don't need to be a painter or musician or poet to find value in this book. Anyone who makes creative decisions can learn a lot of about thinking about how and what to create, and creative decisions can include writing code, building spreadsheets, design, woodworking. Anything that produces something new.

A large portion of this book is about Stoicism. Letting things happen and not feeling the need to control every detail is an aspect of creativity that can feel counter intuitive, but ideas and works come from the universe in one form and need to be shaped into another to become workable.

I am a VERY slow reader for various reasons, and I have been churning this book for a few months. But I feel as if this is a good way to consume this book; chapters are short and concise, and work well as a bite-sized tapas of creative guidance. I'll 100% read this again and still not feel the need to rush it.
