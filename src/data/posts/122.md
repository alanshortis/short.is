Full Metal Jacket is a 10/10 film. Dr. Strangelove is even better than that. With the rapid turnaround of movies-as-products, CGI becoming much cheaper and faster, franchises being a means to get people to the cinema, is there space for someone to make movies like these Kubrick masterpeices?

Seeing scenes that have been shot in real locations, beautifully lit, with subtle film grain and rich colour, really shows just how dead all-digital motion capture CGI franchises look.
