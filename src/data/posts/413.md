Artists who aren't photographers who make me want to take pictures

- **[Edward Hopper](https://www.edwardhopper.net/drugstore.jsp).** Every photo I take is an attempt to emulate any of his paintings. Capturing the light and the loneliness is the eternal goal.
- **[Mark Rothko](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untitled_(Black_on_Grey)>)** might not seem like an obvious choice for photography inspiration, but that simplicity and form in Untitled (Black on Grey) is perfect, to my eye.
- **[Richard Estes](https://www.artnet.com/artists/richard-estes/).** This is cheating, because his near-photo-realistic paintings start life as photographs. The slightly soft, slightly uneven representation of the world make it look almost like a memory of a place, rather than a photo of it.
