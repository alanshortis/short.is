title: 'On places to visit'

There are places to visit alone and there are places to visit with someone else. I can't easily define the distinction, but I know that solo New York visits are something that will happen for the foreseeable. That doesn't exclude the possibility of visiting with someone else.

Lisbon or Morocco are places I'd really rather share with someone.

Copenhagen is borderline.
