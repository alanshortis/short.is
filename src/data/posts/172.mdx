Repeat the below most days for 6 months to get very sad:

- Wake up as late as possible before your first obligation. Nothing to do? Sleep until noon
- Treat anything that requires any kind of effort as a huge burden and put it off for as long as possible
- Don't bother planning your days; just let them happen
- Eat for ease, convenience, and taste over nutrition and balance
- Avoid socialising
- Worry about what others think of you
- Always long for the next, new thing while never appreciating what you have
- Spend money for a quick happiness spike
- Exercise once in a while, but half-ass it
- Berate yourself for all of these behaviours, and speak to yourself in a way that you'd never speak to anyone else
