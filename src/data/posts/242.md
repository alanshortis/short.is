[Poe's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law) states that without a clear indication of the author's intent, it is impossible to create a parody of extreme views so obviously exaggerated that it cannot be mistaken as a sincere expression.

I don't spend a lot of time on social media now, but two examples of this that managed to seep into my eye holes were:

- A meme asking: If the earth is a globe and if gravity is real why doesn't all the water run to the southern hemisphere?
- A [commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUokwmZcFMM) for a '100% woke-free beer', launched in the wake of outrage (faux or legit) over Bud Light partnering with a transgender influencer.

The origin of each of these (flat earthers and people who claim to be anti-woke without being able to define what 'woke' even is) is so fucking stupid they've become impossible to parody.
