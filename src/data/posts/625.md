'The customer is always right' is half a quote. It's not supposed to indicate that someone can be a garbage human in your shop or restaurant and you have to smile and nod.

The full quote is: 'The customer is always right in matters of taste'. It's about the customer's preferences, not their behaviour. You can't tell them that the paint they have chosen is ugly or the album is shit; if they like it, they like it. They're right about those things even if you disagree.
