I can't remember the last time I saw the Red Arrows do a proper display. It's got to be close to 30 years, which is a period of time I still can't fathom being able to fit inside my lifetime with coherent memories and life experiences occurring at either end. But I have seen them every year for the last 4 years as they travel between displays.

Today, in two formations crossing the M1 near Northampton. Last year over the countryside on the blurry boundary and Leicestershire and Rutland. Before that, directly over my house.

I love that they always make these transfers at a low altitude and always in a tight formation. As if they want to be seen and appreciated and ensuring that discipline is present at all times. I wonder if air traffic control treats the formation as a single entity?
