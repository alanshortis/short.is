A weekly series to help me not need to think about ideas quite as much: Music Monday. We'll stick to the record collection for now; that should fill several years of Mondays.

**ALL HANDS_MAKE LIGHT - [Darling the Dawn](https://open.spotify.com/album/58FTPl4ad9kpOGT4rZJivj?si=kUd10pWqRtiEyi0vSSnRGA)**

Nothing too special here. Nice heavy 180g vinyl and clean packaging. I bought it directly from Constellation Records, so it came with a nice hand-written note of thanks.

This features Efrim from Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and Silver Mt Zion, and you can tell. Heavy and discordant, but with a lot of beauty.

While I like this, I can't say I have thought about it much until I pulled it off the shelf to write whatever this is.
