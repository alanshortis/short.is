**Les Claypool, The Eagles Club, Milwaukee, [13th Jun 2006](https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/les-claypools-fancy-band/2006/the-rave-milwaukee-wi-bddc92a.html)**

This is notable for a few reasons. The first show I saw abroad, the first time I travelled abroad alone, the first time seeing Les Claypool (which at the time of writing has ballooned to 23), and I got off a flight from London in Chicago a few hours earlier to meet someone I'd only ever spoken to online.

I've never been more excited for any show before or since, even though I would see Les play another three times in the next week across two more states. I met maybe a dozen more internet people, and people whose names I knew because of the countless bootlegs they'd recorded and I'd acquired by posting blank CDs to them and getting burned CDs back.

We didn't have tickets and didn't originally plan to go; we were seeing them the next night in Chicago, but decided to make the drive anyway. As we approached the box office someone turned around and handed us a pair of tickets, no questions asked. The printed ticket price is 0.00.
