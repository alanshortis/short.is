title: 'On same joke but louder'
---

The soul crushing moment you make a half decent joke too quietly, and someone else repeats is louder and gets the laugh.

Another flavour: a joke lands, someone else makes a joke that is the same but uses different words to get to the same destination.

The worst flavour: the same jokes and observations repeated over and over during work meetings that rely on some constant context, e.g. someone being on mute while talking or having technical issues.
