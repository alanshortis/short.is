**Beastie Boys - [Hello Nasty](https://open.spotify.com/album/6eGYLONkDMja0MNtZWnRRB?si=C1_R1DwUQ_mabsaigjoZbQ)**

This is in my top 5 albums of all time. It's my favourite album of theirs by a very long way, even if I know that Check Your Head is probably their best. In any case, the production is flawless, it's long, it's varied, and my copy is an original pressing from 1998 that I got from eBay. The sleeve is a bit worn, but the disc is flawless and heavy.

I don't like this Spoify version of this album as much, as one track has been butchered because of a sample dispute. Track 13 is 'Can't, Won't, Don't Stop' but this became 'The Grasshopper Unit (Keep Movin')' with the replaced sample.

I believe 1998 was a milestone year for music, and I'd submit this album as supporting evidence.
