Did you see the frightened ones?
Did you hear the falling bombs?
Did you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter when the promise of a brave new world unfurled beneath a clear blue sky?

Did you see the frightened ones?
Did you hear the falling bombs?
The flames are all long gone, but the pain lingers on
Goodbye, blue sky
Goodbye, blue sky
Goodbye
Goodbye

Pink Floyd - Goodbye Blue Sky
