When I worked for McDonalds, almost every shift someone would need to dig through a bin because someone left their keys on the tray before dumping the content.

One of the benefits of my short term memory being broken is that when I get back from the supermarket, half of what I have bought is a nice surprise.

I tried to unlock my front door with my car key remote earlier.

To quote George Carlin, "Think of how stupid the average person is, and realise half of them are stupider than that".
