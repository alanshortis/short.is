The problem with owning a particular kind of car, a car that looks like it might be quick but is really totally average (with the sport mode always off) is that you get a particular kind of car-guy that drives in a certain way. Trying to provoke, have something of a race, or just show that their car is actually something special and not some pastiche of a sports car.

My response to a loud exhaust on a shitbox is never favourable, but who am I to judge someone's hobbies. I can't say that if I had been driving at 17 I wouldn't have had a Saxo or a Nova that wakes up the neighbours.
