As it's been 4 years since I last watched any (mens) football, I'd forgotten about players tendency fall on the floor in feigned agony at the slightest touch, only to get up and carry on once it's clear that the referee isn't going to call a foul.

I recognise that it's part of the game to try and gain any advantage possible, but this brushes a bit too close to cheating for me. And yet, I still find myself watching England during the World Cup every time.
