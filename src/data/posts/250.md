We're really spoiled in the UK with so many free art galleries and museums. Even in Europe, it's no very common.

If the contents of the gallery turns out to be bad, should it be acceptable to ask for a refund? I saw a lot of terrible art today (or rather, not to my taste. Like music there probably isn't 'bad' art, just art I really don't like) and I only found out after handing over some euros.
