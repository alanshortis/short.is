title: 'On the office'

When remote working became mandatory and companies were forced into adopting it and learning how to make things work, I really liked it. The removal of my commute and being in control of my own environment during the day really worked for me.

Three years on and I'm seeing the benefit of the office. The context of this-is-work and this-is-home makes a massive difference to my productivity.

Unfortunately, the office is a 3 hour journey each way. Doing it more than once a week is untenable. Ideally I'd be there three days a week, but in order to do that I'm going to need to live within TfL's network. That just raises the old question: how did I ever afford to live in London?
