Maybe it's because I grew up in a home that often had motorcycle parts in the bath and more assembled bikes in the garage than anyone should own, but if I didn't live in a small borrowed flat and had a useable garage I can see myself having a project car or bike or both.

Maybe we should all be thankful that this limitation is keeping me from putting another stupid modified car on the road. What would it be? I'm not a Miata/MX5 kind of guy, I'll never have enough cash to restore a 1970s Porsche 911, and a good Japanese import would probably be the biggest money pit of all.

Let's settle on a BMW R that is somewhere between faithfully restored and cafe racer abomination.
