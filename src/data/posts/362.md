I always want something to look forward to, and that's almost always travel. I have several flights in the calendar, and knowing it's not long until I get to endure airport security and pla(i)n(e) food keeps me going.

The consequence is that all the days in between feel like a waiting room with really old magazines. Rather than enjoying things each day or week before I can escape from my life again, it's just killing time and looking at plans.
