A long haul economy seat is a hostile place. The person in front will put their seat all the way back, and I'll remain too polite to subject the person behind me to the same. The German couple beside me will mock the flight attendant's voice, openly. The babies will cry for 6 hours. People will stand up over your seat for some reason. The person behind is utterly incapable of getting up without pulling themselves out of their seat by the back of yours. The food container will be too hot to touch and somehow still be frozen in the middle. Someone will suggest they take your bag from the overhead so they can put theirs up there.

But for Not much money you get transported to another part of the world THROUGH THE SKY. It's worth it.
