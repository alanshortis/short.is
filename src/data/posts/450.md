9th November 1993. A Tribe Called Quest release Midnight Marauders, and Wu-Tang Clan release Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers). How often to two undeniable classics come out in the same year, let alone the same day? Both albums transcend genre and are as relevant today as they were 30 years ago.

My brain is wired to think that a 30 year old album should be jazz or classic rock, and that an album released in 2003 is recent. Time doesn't make sense.
