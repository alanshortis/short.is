With the first half of the first season of True Detective being set in around 1995, there are some really perfect music references. Marty, when dressed down, wears a Pink Floyd t-shirt from the 1994 Pulse tour. When Rust meets some old biker contacts in a bar, we hear Melvins and Primus. And, the stash house they then hit is soundtracked with Wu Tang Clan.

Closing out the same episode with Griderman is the not quite period correct cherry on the cake.
