I don't really care about basketball, but I loved [The Last Dance](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Dance_(miniseries)>) and that was enough to go to United Centre to see the Bulls. A lot of it was to see the retired numbers and championship banners in the rafters (for both the Bulls and the Blackhawks) but the game was fine, too.

[The Bear](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bear_(TV_series)>) is one of the best TV shows of the last few years, so why not eat Italian Beef at the restaurant used for the show? They still operate as they always have; cash only, little to no patience for indecision when its your turn, and a loaded sandwich that's as greasy as it is tasty. I nearly didn't go inside because of the huge line which would have been a really dumb move.
