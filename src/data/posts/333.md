I have unfortunately found something worse than endless scrolling of mindless TikTok posts. Lengthy compilations of these videos made by someone who explains how bad they are. It's like I can let myself off for watching this shit as long as I'm watching it because I recognise that it's bad. Which is probably even worse.

The algorithm and idle hands.
