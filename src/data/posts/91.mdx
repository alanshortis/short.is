Watching the same movies and TV shows on repeat. Yeah, maybe the throw-away movies and series that pop up on Netflix before vanishing are fine but they're never going to appear in top-whatever lists. Though whether or not those lists actually have any value is another story.

Netflix series will become a cultural phenomenon for a very brief period, driving up sales of chess boards and accusations of husband-murder, but someone can say 'Royale with Cheese' some 28 years later and you can see the scene in your head.
