[Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/a_________s) tells me that TOOL is number 2 in my all time listening history. 'All time' being since the end of 2002 - my tendency to get rid of things means my account that started in 2005 is long gone.

Tonight I saw TOOL for the 6th time, and I'm sorry to say that it was not good.

The venue was seated, and security were very strict on people staying by their seat. This means I had to stay in one spot, and that one spot was behind tall people and next to people who talked for the entire show. The setlist wasn't great, with only one track from Ænima and Lateralus, though some material from Undertow was a huge high point for me. The sound was muddy, and this was from a floor seat right beside the mix.

I appreciate how lucky I am to be able to afford to see these shows. The ticket prices are FUCKING STUPID, parking at £15, food and drink obviously 100% more than reasonable, and they had a signed poster for sale for £2,500.

I remember clearly sitting on the floor outside Brixton Academy in 2001, barely able to come to terms with what [I had just seen](https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/tool/2001/brixton-academy-london-england-3bd65494.html). It was off the scale amazing. I'd like to feel that again after a show, I just don't think it's going to be TOOL.
