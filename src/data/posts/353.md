The bike BMC make some pretty high-end stuff. But it feels a little less impressive when you know that BMC stands for Bicycle Manufacturing Company. Another bike component brand, FSA, expands out to Full Speed Ahead. No thanks.

The exotic-sounding Maserati Quattroporte translates to 'four door'. Pretty matter of fact.
