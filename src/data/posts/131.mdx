I've hit that point where I am a little dissatisfied with how this site looks. It's been a while since anything much changed but familiarity breeds contempt; it's starting to look a bit tired and uninspired.

Is making a change a good use of time? How much change would I need to make to feel better about it? There is also the fact that large parts of the CSS was written in a hurry and is getting more difficult to follow, especially where I have tried to accommodate different scenarios.
