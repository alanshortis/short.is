A weird side effect of getting older that I never considered: Films I have known and enjoyed for 15 or 20 years hit differently. Catching up to or exceeeding the age of key characters changes how I feel about their predicaments or story arcs. I can relate to or understand a scanario they're expeeriencing in a whole new way, or I have memory of aspiring to the kind of life a character has and yet I am still exactly where I was.

I just watched [Sideways](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375063/) and I am nearly 5 years older than Paul Giamatti was when it was made. Which is fine. Completely fine.
