**Bj√∂rk - [Biophilia](https://www.discogs.com/release/3163861-Bj%C3%B6rk-Biophilia)**

I should take better care of this album. It's dusty, and I can't even remember the last time it was on the spinner. It's a gatefold, lyrics printed on the sleeve for each disc, and some of cleanest and sharpest printing I'e ever seen. I also love that it features a custom font that is barely legible.

The nicest detail, is the download card is a heavyweight laminated card, whose design matches the rest of the package. Not some generic download code card that is easily discarded.
