Driving in central London has a particular frequency. Traffic lights keep the flow, cars and bikes flow around busses and cyclists, from main roads to narrow back streets, parallel parking and fees.

The A1 starts as a busy city street and moves north, growing into 4 lane highways and heading all the way to Edinburgh.
