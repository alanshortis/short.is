Ideas are cheap. Execution is everything.

I don't build apps, but I can understand why people think I do. It's all the same thing; making boxes on a screen. I have lost count of the number of times someone has told me they have an idea for an app that's going to be vastly popular, and I politely decline. I've never seen any of them even make it past the idea phase.

I'm not good at execution either. When working on this site, I have a branch that has progress for a photography section that pre-dates ALL 573 daily posts. When taking photographs, I have an idea of what I want to get but I almost always leave my camera at home and never make enough effort to put myself in the right place at the right time to get the shot.

Who gives a fuck about ideas.
