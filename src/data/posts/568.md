X. Formerly Twitter. And formerly useable.

I ventured back to see how much content was being added by some more notable people in my field, as in it's heyday it was excellent. It's now been ruined by a few changes since the dumbest billionaire in the world took it on:

- People can post massive walls of text. Ok, but that's not really what made it special
- Porn. So much porn. So many women pushing their onlyfans accounts under any post that is close to viral
- People now getting money for engagement means viral posts that would have previously had interesting discussion below is propping up a sea of blue ticks posting unrelated content to get their engagement up

Twitter was never perfect, but we really never know how good things were until they're gone.
