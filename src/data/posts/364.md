All my bikes have or have had names. My Ridley bikes were Riley and Riley II, my Merlin is named Gandalf, My Condor is called Francis (Condor. Connie. Connie Francis.).

Years ago, I was on a date with someone who had a lot of tattoos, including one or two animals. I asked what their names were, and apparently I was weird for thinking they should have been given names in the first place.
