I love Pink Floyd, but I can understand Roger Waters' stupid attempts to wrap up the band following his departure when I watch the Delicate Sound of Thunder concert film.

Leaning into the 80s aesthetic, it sounds a synthetic. The band are poorly rehearsed, David seems coked up (and probably was), Nick is placed at the front of the stage for some weird reason, and there is a huge amount of focus on the audience. The soulful and sombre Saxophone work from the 70s albums is performed by a man with a bleached blonde mullet through some effects that crush all of the emotion. It's very clearly an over-correction for Roger's whole concept of building a wall between the band and the audience.

I think Gilmour knew all of this. The following tour and film for Pulse is leagues ahead; everyone brings their A-game, the production is remarkable, Dick Parry, who played on Dark Side of the Moon originally, is back on Sax. David plays probably the [finest solo of all time](https://youtu.be/7kWl-ZGMwkQ?si=wjvemFRfnRcg0PHl) while in jeans and a t-shirt.

There is a catch, though. Delicate Sound of Thunder was captured on film and has a 4K remaster. Pulse was filmed using DV tape and is as high definition as it's ever going to be. It looked amazing played on [laserdisc](https://www.discogs.com/release/2610967-Pink-Floyd-Pulse) on a 4:3 CRT TV in 1995.
