Mark Cavendish had to abandon the Tour de France today. His last tour, in which he has been clearly the fastest sprinter but beset with bad luck. Had he won a stage he would hold the outright record for stage wins, a record he currently shares with Eddy Merckx. Had he not, it would have been a victory lap for one of the greatest of all time. But what he got was an abrupt exit and a shared record.

Also this weekend, the British Grand Prix in a season where it's becoming more and more obvious that Lewis Hamilton will also need to share a record with Michael Schumacher for seven world titles.

I used to think each of these records were out of reach but with Tadej Pogaƒçar having 10 stage wins at 24 years old and Max Verstappen on his way to a third world title at 25 I'm not so sure.
