Trying to set up Plex. I'm sure I haven't used Plex before. But once logged in, it turns out I 100% have. Back once again to the obsession-of-the-time from the mid-2000s when following Les Claypool around to see as many shows as possible and getting audience recordings of the ones I missed, I have access to a notable setlist compiler's server where I find a recording of the 2023 New Years Eve show.

Les Claypool plays New Years Eve every year. More than 20 since I became a fan. And I've never been.
