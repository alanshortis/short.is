title: 'On building pointless things'

While watching TV I made a stupid app that sits between someone owing me money and me getting paid. Send them an address like this: [https://pay.short.is/10](https://pay.short.is/10) and they're given the option to go to PayPal or Monzo to make the actual payment.

It's very well built and there are issues, but being able to practice and just make stuff is going to be good for getting back to feeling like I', pretty ok at my job.
