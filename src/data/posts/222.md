title: 'On building pointless things'

While watching TV I made a stupid app that sits between someone owing me money and me getting paid. Send them an address like this: [https://pay.short.is/10](https://pay.short.is/10) and they're given the option to go to PayPal or Monzo to make the actual payment.

It's very poorly built and there are no doubt plenty of issues, but for a couple of hours work it's fine. Being able to practice and just make and ship ANYTHING without it needing to be perfect is going to be good for getting back to feeling like I don't hate my job.
