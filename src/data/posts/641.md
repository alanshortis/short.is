Back on my Red Dead Redemption 2 bullshit. The missions are fine, but all I want to do is explore the wilderness, hunt, find herbs and generally avoid any NPC interaction.

I had a trip to the pacific north west planned, but because of the cost I have been gradually moving it back. RDR2, and the wilderness it provides, has me wanting to go sooner.
