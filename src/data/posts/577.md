Jazz disappointment isn't some kind of freeform setback, although it could be. No, today this is the double tap of visiting the Nation Jazz Museum in Harlem and finding that it's one small room with very little in it, and then going to the Blue Note jazz club (finally!) and discovering that a ticket that allows bar access offers a very obstructed view of the stage and a chorus of dishwashers and ice machines.
