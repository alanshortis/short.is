To try and move into a third career stage, I need to stop putting it off and learn more mathematics.

I wasn't very good at maths in school and I can barely remember even the most basic concepts. I use what is essentially algebra every day when writing code, but the code I write is not solving complex problems and any logic is more about how to present information.

A big problem with how maths was taught to me at school was a lack of practical uses for what we were learning. Telling me that something is the way it is doesn't help to make it stick. Showing me how it can be used attaches it to something I can understand. I don't remember ever being told the purpose of replacing numbers with letters, or the concept of a variable. I learned all of this later when I started to write VB and Classic ASP to make better spreadsheets. Starting with the problem and learning the solution.
