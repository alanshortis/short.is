**Primus, Roundhouse, London, [20th June 2017](https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/primus/2017/roundhouse-london-england-7be496c0.html), Â£40**

One of the relatively few times I have seen Les Claypool play in the UK, and the only time I've been to the roundhouse. The last time I saw Primus, and the only time with original drummer, Tim.

Two sets, 22 songs, most songs extended or modified. Like every Les Claypool show I have seen, different to every other Les Claypool show I have seen.
