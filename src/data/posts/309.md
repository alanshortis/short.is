Companies get stick for putting up a pride themed avatar on their social networks only for pride month, but this is a bit of a lose-lose situation. By not doing this, they'd like come in for more outrage.

Performative actions like cannot be the sole action taken; companies should act in a way that supports people in the queer community year around. I personally don't do anything 'visible', but stonewall gets a donation every year.

A more analogue version of the avatar change that I have noticed a few times recently is a proudly displayed pride flag that is still extremely creased having only just come out of its made-in-China packaging.
