**Beastie Boys - [Aglio E Olio](https://open.spotify.com/album/6MSLIJR6KnM8UFigEnDX2x?si=9xRl53eDRmG9hAGQrX0pLw)**

Punk Beastie Boys was not something I liked immediately. I had the sounds of science best of on CD and I loved it, but often skipped anything that wasn't hip hop.

There is a myth that your music taste sticks at around 24 years old, but there was a moment in the 30s where things just clicked. Dead Kennedys and Black Flag were suddenly perfect, and Beastie Boys made another appearance.

This album is short and sharp, and was recorded in 1995, a long time after they'd cemented themselves as hip hop royalty. I don't think I can name a band as diverse and legendary. I'd go so far as to say they're the best hip hop group of all time (Wu Tang are a crew, before you get upset) AND they have this whole other side to them.
