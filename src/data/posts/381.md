These facts about my first drum teacher are so absurd, you'd be forgiven for thinking I made them up:

- Lived with is parents
- Drove a Ferrari
- Owned a power boat named 'wet dream', which was on his parent's driveway
- His regular gig was pre-disgrace Gary Glitter
- He was the touring drummer for Take That at the beginning, but quit because he didn't think it would go anywhere
