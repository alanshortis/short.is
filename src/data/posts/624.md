F1 is currently not very interesting. While we saw dominance from Lewis and Mercedes, there was still a variety of winners and pole-sitters. While I respect the talent, Max is cruising to victories. It's enough for me to not watch the races and just wait for YouTube highlights.

The off-track drama is much more entertaining at this point. Entertaining and, in the case of Christian Horner, pretty gross. He's holding on to his position so tight that, like an ice cube, it'll just melt unless he loosens his grip a little. Lewis decamping to Ferrari was something, Adrian Newey leaving Red Bull and his move to the red team being all but confirmed might give the long suffering tifosi some release.
