Inspired to clean the house. Inspired to get he car deep cleaned and then inspired to clean it some more because they left a lot of streaks. Inspired to clear out old books. Inspired to throw stuff out that I'll frantically look for in a few weeks.

Inspired to relax before winding down to sleep earlier, as I'm trying to get up earlier. Find a [fresh upload](https://youtu.be/pfQNRtBp1vs) from my favourite YouTube photographer who happens to have been shooting in a part of the USA I am visiting later in the year.

Inspired to edit some more of my negatives, at entirely the wrong end of the day.
