Walking London listening to slow, spacious music can make the place feel very different. Block out all other sound and instead fill everything with Moor Mother, Low, Emma Ruth Rundle, of The Field.

I don't think I have ever listened to hip hop in the mountains. And I don't think post rock has ever felt right in urban areas.

My memory before the age of around 16 is very patchy, but I clearly remember driving through the middle of London at night with my Dad (long before congestion and emissions charges) with some Jazz, probably Miles Davis, playing. It smoothed out every corner and pothole and made the journey immersive and so much more than just transport.
