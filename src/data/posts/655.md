I now have more than 1,000 pins in Google Maps. When I see something that I think I'd like to visit, I save it. You never know.

175 of these pins are in New York, and this is probably the only set of pins I might actually complete. The remaining pins are spread across Europe and North America, with only a handful elsewhere. Further proof that I seem to be less interested in travelling to Asia and Africa.

Should money suddenly not be an issue, I'd fly to Denver, hire a car, and work my way round as many pins as possible. They range from interesting looking diners, to major monuments, to absolutely pointless arbitrary points (the middle of the USA, the four corners, etc). I want to see them all, and I need more lives to do it.
