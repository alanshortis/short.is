Compound anger sources:

1. Driving around the kind of people whose erratic and bizarre adherence to road rules has me trying to remember if I have the number for my insurer stored in my phone
2. Listening to people on LBC, one arguing that people should have few kids and the other arguing that we need people to have more. Neither considering the reasons people might not want to bring a new person into the world.

I can manage the irritation of each of these independently, but at the same time is just too much.
