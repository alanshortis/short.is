title: 'On doing good work'

Somehow getting to a management position when working for McDonalds, I was in a position where I had to motivate people who didn't give a shit and hated their jobs to try and do good work.

I believed then what I believe now; if you hate your job, do the absolute best you can every day. At least then you can come away from each day feeling good about the work done. Being a mope while doing the job just accentuates the hate for it all.
