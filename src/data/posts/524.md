When planning highways, there is this myth that adding more lanes will eliminate traffic issues. But as always, that additional space fills up due to induced demand; when the roads appear to be more accessible, more people will use them.

A similar and just as vital issue is: If I buy more shelves to store vinyl, will I just buy more vinyl? My storage is now at capacity and it's keeping me from buying more because I want to ensure everything is safe and sound. Spending money on nice new shelves is an open door to giving too much of my money to Rough Trade.
