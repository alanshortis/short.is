I need someone to stop me from arguing with idiots on the internet. It doesn't happen often, but in the last few days I have found myself debating ULEZ (you know, it's possible to care about pollution and think that another tax on the poor is bad at the same time) and trans people being allowed to join a non-competitive cycling club.

No one is going to change anyone's mind. No one comes away from a thread on Reddit thinking 'hmm yes I really was in the wrong there'. I might as well argue with the screaming pillow.
