title: 'On vinyl fragility'
---

An ongoing project/goal is to own my 100 favourite albums on vinyl. There are two problems:

- I haven't yet determined what my 100 favourite albums are. I have made it as far as 68 without repeating any artists, so maybe it's time to break that rule
- I found and received a copy of one of my all-time favourite jazz albums, Shack Man by Medeski Martin and Wood. I somehow got a copy of this in the mid 90s as a teenager, something my school music teacher thought was really strange. Anyway, the record arrived and it was like a pringle. So warped it barely clears the cartridge. I've tried the old trick of putting it between two sheets of glass in the sun, but it's still not playable. Do I keep it and try to correct it, or do I return it and hope to find another copy?
