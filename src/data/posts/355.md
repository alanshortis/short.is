Where I used to spend my whole Sunday dreading work on Monday, I sacrifice just half an hour of my weekend to checking what I need to do at work for the coming week. Ensure the tickets I need have been created, have a think about what I might need from other people and send messages or invites, and maybe make a new branch for the code I need to write.

After being so extremely protective of personal time and never allowing it to be diluted, doing this make my Monday immeasurably better by removing the unknowns and getting my head in the game a little earlier.
