Some deliberate and some accidental YouTube views earlier today led to:

- Agreeing with a point made by someone who I generally find detestable
- Finding an opinion from someone whose whole ethos and approach I loved detestable

I won't name names, though my left-leaning tendencies might narrow things down a little. But I think it's important to remember that you can still enjoy someone's good qualities and points of view while dismissing the bad.
