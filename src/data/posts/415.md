> Six Feet Under spoilers kind of

Six Feet Under is the best TV show of all time. To me, at least. But early in season 4 there is an episode that I often skip because it's extremely hard to watch.

David picks up a hitchhiker and it turns in a drawn-out hostage/assault/drug situation, and having seen him grow through the preceding three seasons it's too hard to watch.

The ripples go out into two other Shows; House and Dexter.

I cannot watch Dexter because Michael C Hall can only ever be David Fisher to me. The hitchhiker appears in House as a private detective or something and I can't watch that either. Not because I can't separate the character from the actor, but because I fucking hate his stupid voice and face and what the bastard did to David.
