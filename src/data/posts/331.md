I wonder if I'd have been the kind of person who'd get on a ship and go to the new world. And once I'm in the American east, take the arduous journey to the new-new world in the west. Lawlessness, justifiably upset native Americans, and wild animals just trying to protect their territory and their young, but a chance to get in on the ground floor.

How many generations do you need to go back to find someone in your family who did things previously undone and travelled to places previously undiscovered? It's not like the remaining frontiers of the ocean floor (famously dangerous in a carbon fibre tube) and space (ruined by shitty billionaires) are attainable by regular people who just want to find a better life.
