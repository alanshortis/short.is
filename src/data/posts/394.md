Not long ago there were open arguments on Twitter (pre-X, pre-implosion) with TypeScript faithful falling out with CSS nerds, with both sides being pretty wrong in a variety of ways. Just another example of how in this stupid career I have accidentally landed in there is a perpetual undercurrent of reinvention in ways that don't make a single thing better for end users.

TypeScript helps to make better and more reliable products but to be it feels like it's often taught in the wrong way. Trying to make the complier 'happy' rather than seeing the type system as providing guard rails.

CSS is [introducing type safety](https://nerdy.dev/cant-break-this-design-system) via `@property` and I'm curious as to how some of the previously contrary and loud type detractors are going to back-flip their way to loving this addition to the language.

Maybe it'll be just the right gateway drug for the type-averse to start seeing the benefits.
