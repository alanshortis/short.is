The traditional parting gift from New York to me. Second visit of the year, second bout of Covid. Fortunately not as severe as the first (so far) but still pretty unwelcome as I can't really take any time off work.

That scene in Pi where he uses a drill on his skull to lobotomise himself? That, but to take the pressure and the constant headache out of my dome.

As soon as I'm done being contagious I might need to check Flotation Tank of the bucket list and get fucking relaxed, but not so relaxed I think I'm [still in there](https://youtu.be/plmKsAUdJ-Q).
