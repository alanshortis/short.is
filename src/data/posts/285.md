There is no faster way to feel a deep sense of rage and disbelief than browsing LinkedIn for 10 minutes. The depth of complete bullshit woven into faux-revelatory inspiration-bait is staggering. Being able to take some mundane facet of life and use it to attempt to prove some BUSINESS point requires some next-level ego and narcissism.

If it's not that, it's cherry picking arguments to prove a point, reposting some AI think-piece that boldly claims that certain industries will be killed off, shameless self-promotion that only appeals to the similarly affected, or recruiters openly complaining about candidates.

It all reminds me of the calibre of a lot of the advertising that is shown during Formula 1 broadcasting. Some IT product that doesn't have a consumer market being aimed at business decision makers during what should be downtime, using trite hooks like 'From F1 to Q1'.

I have landed more than one job via LinkedIn, so there is a clear purpose. But the quantity of recruiters who have just ghosted me the moment an offer isn't viable far outweighs the recruiters who genuinely want to place people into the right roles. I have had one job that paid commission, and every one of my co-workers made bad sells to get the cash.
