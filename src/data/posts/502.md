Some highlights from the year:

- New York (a few times), Chicago, Vienna, and Bratislava
- Roger Waters live in Birmingham. I haven't seen anything at an arena for a long time, and this was next level with a vast light show, inflatables, and a flawless setlist. It's a shame he's such an asshole
- My 23rd Les Claypool show, in Chicago. He played Pink Floyd's Animals in full, something that was done nearly 20 years ago and I never thought I'd be able to see it. [The Salt Shed](https://www.saltshedchicago.com/) is one of the best venues I've been to, too
- Joe Lovano at Birdland in January, and again at the Village Vanguard in November. Two legendary New York jazz clubs
- [At Atlas of Es Devlin](https://www.cooperhewitt.org/channel/es-devlin/) at the Cooper Hewitt in New York. Hands down the best exhibition I've ever seen
- [Edward Hopper's New York](https://whitney.org/exhibitions/edward-hopper-new-york) at the Whitney. Not just paintings of loneliness, but sketches, studies, and some design work
- Finally, as it wasn't part of the Hopper show in New York, a visit to the Art Institute of Chicago to see [Nighthawks](https://www.artic.edu/articles/808/nighthawks-as-a-symbol-of-hope)
