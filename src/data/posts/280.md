While I'm fucking around with 3kg dumbbells there is some guy nearby doing a 3ft box just like it's nothing.

Very gymed men lifting my bodyweight while weighing far less than I do. Women looking like a Gym Shark catalogue and only doing glute exercises.

It's best to just look at the floor and do what I need to do.
