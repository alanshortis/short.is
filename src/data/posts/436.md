Like a new iPhone every year, Sony brings out a new version of their A7 camera every year. Small increments forwards,and always something new to sell.

The latest Leica is the M11. First in the M range came to market in 1954. While technology moved far slower through the 50s to the 90s, even the digital M cameras have a very slow release cycle with the first, the M8, coming to market in 2006 and the M11 coming out in 2022, with years between each iteration.

You can take an M lens from the 50s and fit it to a 2023 M11-P and it will work with no adapters or tricks. And likewise, a brand new M lens will fit on an M3. The compatibility is built in, over nearly 70 years.

How many products available today will still be a top-tier option in 2093?
