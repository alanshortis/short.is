I think I might have finally swung over to the opinion that the US office is better than the original, UK version.

I like the original a lot, but there are some jokes that have not aged well, Ricky Gervais has become more and more unbearable over the years, and the general bleakness of the show is a bit hard to take and a bit too close to the reality of a dire office job.

The US version is possibly a bit too long, but once it gets out of the early phase of mirroring the original episode structures it's generally more good-hearted and easier to watch.
