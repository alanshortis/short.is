There are moments of clarity where I can tell myself that the past is the past and cannot be changed, but the future can be whatever I can make it. I know it's true, but it's much easier to think about than put into practice.

Then I think about the past. Three people in particular. How things could have been different, why they did what they did, and if they ever think about things in the way that I do.

They don't.
