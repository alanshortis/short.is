It's exceptionally cruel that the three of the four best TV shows of the last 10 years (in my opinion; you might not agree and that's ok) are all ending forever this week.

**Succession.** I watched this today, and it was the perfect culmination of the chaos of the last season. How the lives of all the main characters will play out is alluded to, yet left to interpretation. No irritating loose ends but enough left unsaid so as not to leave you feeling spoon fed.

**Barry.** It's a shame that Barry hasn't had the mass appeal of Succession. Extraordinarily funny, extraordinarily dark, and the finale that is a perfect satire of Hollywood. Some, including Larry David, felt that it should have ended at the end of season 3. This finale proves that idea wrong.

**Ted Lasso.** This will be shown on Wednesday, but I'm fairly sure it won't contain anything unexpected. This show is far more about the journey and growth for the entire cast, rather than a series of events that build up to any kind of conclusion. Ted will go home, just as he was always going to.

The fourth show is Better Call Saul. The Breaking Bad spinoff that became better than Breaking Bad ever was. But that's another story.
