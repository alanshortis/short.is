I having at least 5 big travel ideas planned in detail healthy? Today's handiwork:

- Vancouver to Anchorage
- Anchorage to Fairbanks
- Fairbanks to Seattle
- Seattle to Vancouver

That might seem like a strange sequence, but with the terrain and international borders involved it's a sound plan that time efficient. The train journey between Anchorage and Fairbanks looks absolutely spectacular, and has a price tag to match.

If money suddenly became no object, some people would think about the things they'd buy or the businesses they'd start. I'd travel endlessly. Or at least until I can't stand travelling alone any longer.
