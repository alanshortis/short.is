Zildjian was always my choice of cymbal, despite my time playing drums being at probably my most broke (though, this expensive taste was fortunate when the time came to sell them all in order to pay bills).

The Avedis Zildjian Company is 400 years old, starting in Constantinople in 1623. Now based in the USA, it's still run by the Zildjian family who keep the secret of the alloy used in their cymbals.
