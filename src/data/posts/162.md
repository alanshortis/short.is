The doomsday clock is a symbol to indicate how close we are to global catastrophe. Midnight represents doom, and minutes represent proximity. Since its introduction in 1947, it has ranged from 17 minutes in 1991 to just 90 seconds. Yesterday.

There is likely to some bias to the west/north with the decision to move so close to midnight being driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, despite so much conflict across the rest of the wold that doesn't get the coverage. This feels different though. Nato countries choosing to provide tanks to Ukraine could be just enough provocation to Putin to go nuclear.

To be closer to midnight than at any point during the cold war is a big deal.
