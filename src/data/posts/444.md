Wars of the future will be won or lost via disinformation spread online. People are extremely susceptible to online opinions that amplify what they already think, and it doesn't take much to nudge people to more extreme points of view when there is already some level of agreement.

Israel have sponsored tweets pushing their agenda while the commit literal genocide, using language to evoke an emotional response that makes people excuse the barbarism behind the veil of having the right to defend themselves.

Somehow calling for a ceasefire and an end to killing of civilians is easily labelled an extreme position.

The only good vs evil here is the good of the oppressed vs the evil of the oppressor. Civilians vs Hamas and the Israeli government.
