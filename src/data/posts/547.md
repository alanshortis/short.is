title: 'On Bonnie and Clyde'

Local 'proper' cinema opted to mark valentines day with a showing of Bonnie and Clyde, and it was pretty chaotic. Rabid banjo soundtrack to accompany car chases with ballsy off-roading, that entire section with Gene Wilder that serves as comic relief but could really have just been cut, the scenes with Bonnie's mother that were clearly shot with too little light, and zero resolution beyond a hail of bullets.

To add the chaos, they bought the lights up about a minute before the credits rolled. By that point, I think most people were ready to head to the bar.
