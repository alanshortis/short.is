Acceptable times for audience interaction by genre:

- Pop, Rock, Metal, Hip-Hop: Any time. Make some noise. Maybe try to keep it down during the quiet bits
- Jazz: After the solos, and at the end of the piece. Otherwise, shut up
- Classical: At the end of the piece. Don't you dare be a philistine and clap between movements. Also, don't forget the conductor needs to be adored with several curtain calls
