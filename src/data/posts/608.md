**Aphex Twin - [Come to Daddy](https://open.spotify.com/album/6sIEBpy5gl3DqC6KPasPpx?si=7ibL_pWISculD02mAmWkNQ)**

A hangover from my very brief stint of playing record at 93 Feet East occasionally. If you don't know the title, you probably know the [mildly terrifying video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZ827lkktYs).

It's not all horror; [Flim](https://open.spotify.com/track/3JJ4BoL9WVHk4Yye2EGJC7?si=26d4f33985fa47ea) is one of the prettiest pieces of music you could ask for.

I'm a man in his 40s so obviously I own this.
