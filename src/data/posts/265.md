Bricolage is a term to excuse an accumulation of junk, in my case. It's not quite the scene in Apollo 13 where they create a missing component with whatever they have on the ship.

I have a shelf with a mechanical keyboard, a can of Liquid Death, a Dymo label maker that I really wish worked, a Old Holborn tobacco tin that belonged to my Dad, postcards, rocks, a copy of Animals on tape, a copy of Ten Bullets, matches, coins, light bulb, glassware.

Useless stuff that I want to keep.
