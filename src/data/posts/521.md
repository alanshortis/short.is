British Airways and O2 have managed to select their hold music to the exact specifications required to be incredibly irritating and near-painful to those of us with tinnitus.

Is it a deliberate ploy to get us to hang up? And how is it that I can watch live TV at 4K on a huge TV and yet a phone call sounds like a tin can and string?

During my time at HMV there was a literal CD player plumbed into the phone system. Benign and tame music was rotated, but one time a ostensibly mellow Ryan Adams album featured the lyric 'that shit just fucks you up' which led to a customer becoming so angry they forgot why they called in the first place.
