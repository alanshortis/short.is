Back-to-back meetings that need half-attention are absolutely soul crushing. Paying enough attention to participate in the tiny section that requires input while also trying not to completely waste the semi-idle time is like juggling.

I once worked with someone who would simultaneously complain that they needed to attend ANY meetings and get claim that they never knew what management wanted from them. Meetings are not universally bad, but they can destroy motivation and productivity.
