Sorry to spoil things for you fast food fans, but the little bow-tie under Colonel Sanders' head on the [KFC logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KFC) is definitely a little stick-man body.

Like the Trump/Pence logo from the 2016 election, or the Airbnb logo, you can depend on the internet (and those with dirty minds) to find the most inappropriate interpretation of a logo. At least the KFC logo is just silly.
