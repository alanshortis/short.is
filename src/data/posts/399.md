In a real photography rut once again. Getting the colour I want is proving to be impossible, with either right right kind of colour but a weird tint, or very flat, or lacking saturation, or something that is very close to natural and rich colour but I missed the focus.

Black and white isn't as appealing to me as it once was, but it's not lost on me that my photos I like the best came from a camera that cost Â£30 and were shot paying next to zero attention to the technicalities, instead being much more aware of my surroundings. And maybe going to black and white is a bit of a cop out?

Like a lot of things, maybe I'm an appreciator and I just don't have the ability to do it myself. Or maybe, like a lot of things, I have stupidly high expectations of myself.
