Before The Bear, there was Treme.

Where so many of the biggest shows seem to focus on criminals, police, or war, Treme is about people across New Orleans trying to rebuild their homes and lives in the wake of Katrina. It features real New Orleans musicians mixed in with fictional ones, and recreates the origins of Donald Harrison's Indian Blues album, and of course also features mardi gras indians and the tradition surrounding them.

Along with the real musicians, there are real chefs. David Chang plays a big part when a chef moves to New York after losing their restaurant, a trick copied in The Bear; mixing reality and fiction to place the story closer to reality.

I have still never been to New Orleans, but I don't think it's a city that appeals to introverted solo travellers.
