Why spend 10 minutes trying to understand something when you can go for the knee-jerk instant reaction from a position of ignorance?

The literal words used or the way something literally looks, free of any context or background, rarely tell the entire truth. Being 'for' something doesn't automatically make someone 'against' something else. Changing your mind is fine. Stubbornly sticking to your guns despite new knowledge and evidence is not.
