Hobby three: Bass guitar.

It's that gap between music appreciation and musical ability. I would love to be able to play [Chicken Grease](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4XI6LXCsH8) while not being Pino Palladino. The fact that I could probably still play ?uestlove's part on that track to a passable standard has fooled me into thinking I could get that syncopation on the bass just right.
