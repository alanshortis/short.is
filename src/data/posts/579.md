title: 'On Nate Smith'

After Friday's Jazz Disappointment, I decided to go back to the Blue Note with a better ticket and a very punctual arrival time, and it was worth it

I have admired Nate Smith as a drummer for a long time, and the fact that I didn't know the people he was playing with didn't matter. No known songs were played, just 90 minutes of improvisation.

It was fascinating to hear all these little motifs emerge over the course of the set; everyone on stage listening to each other and adapting, making these totally spontaneous moments of music sound anything but.
