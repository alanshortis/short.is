title: 'On April and Satire'
---

The absolutely absurd shit that happens daily in politics, highly convincing fakes generated by AI, and a society increasingly obsessed with attention in any form, convincing April Fools jokes that seem believable but are also funny once the truth is revealed have been all-but non-existent for a few years now.

Covid, Trump, Boris, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Andrew Tate. In any functioning society these things wouldn't be real and might make you spit your cereal on the first day of April.
