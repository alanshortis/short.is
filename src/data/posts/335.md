As I am back on my Red Dead Redemption II bullshit, I am torn between a strong desire to spend many hours exploring the game and feeling guilty for not being productive. Whatever that means.

The vast open world, based on what I think is Colorado, Wyoming, Arizona, and Louisiana feels alive. Hours and hours or exploration is barely the tip of the iceberg. Hundreds of animals to study and hunt, countless settlements, caves, abandoned buildings, and developing cities, the largest of which appears to be based on New Orleans. A city I have a fascination with having never visited.

My postponed plans to visit Colorado and Wyoming this year put them at the top of the list, right beside New Orleans. I want to experience both the empty country of the western states and the electricity of Mardi Gras in the Big Easy.

Plenty of life left to make them happen. Though, not to get on my sad-boy bullshit, it would be nice to share it with someone.
