title: 'On making a rod for your own back'
---

To make a rod for your own back is to create problems now that your future self will have to endure.

Deciding to make this a daily thing started with the best intentions. I wanted it to be a discipline, I didn't want to keep writing technical blog posts, and I wanted to keep it accountable. While I do write something every day, recently I haven't been able to publish daily, let alone actually write something worth reading (some might say I never manage that part).

My present self does this sort of thing all the time. If I stop working out and eat more, that's a problem for my future self to solve. My past self is an asshole, my present self is in denial about it, and my future self will be the one to suffer.

Shifting to a state of recognising that my past, present, and future selves need to work together sounds so simple in principle, but bank accounts have over drafts and credit card exist.
