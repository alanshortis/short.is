The Mandela Effect is a phenomenon where a large group of people remember something differently than how it occurred. Ironically it's named after widely held false memory of Nelson Mandela dying in prison in the 1980s; something I simply cannot fathom as his release from prison and presidency wasn't exactly a small event.

With the internet able to propagate falsehoods in record width and girth, this is going to become more common. In tandem with AI edits, is the 'truth' going to become whatever is just accepted by the most people?
