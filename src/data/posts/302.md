At Alton Towers (a theme park), there is a rule that none of the rides are allowed to be taller than the tree line.

Being relatively close and in a beautiful part of the country, just to the south of the Peak District, I have cycled past it more than once. When riding around the back, there are no signs of the park being there at all but you can hear loud metallic noises punctuated with people screaming.
