title: 'On Spotify wrapped'

Please let me be strong enough to resist the temptation to share my Spotify wrapped. I don't care about yours, and you don't care about mine. I have to live the shame of my most listened music being from a band that's fairly widely hated.

One funny quirk: this year they name a place in the world where your musical taste seems to resonate. For me, it's Portland, Oregon. I made plans to visit there next year earlier this week.

I am an endlessly predictable stereotype.
