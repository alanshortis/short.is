Classical music has wonderfully functional naming. There may be a name for the overall composition, but in the case of a symphony (which is numbered), we get numbered movements whose name might mention the key, the tempo, the opus number (a count of the composers pieces), and sometimes other initials that refer to the catalogue the piece is a part of.

The title refers only to all the movements together, and the movements are named to inform performers and collectors.

Rothko's paintings are numbered, describe the colour, or are just untitled. Giving such abstract work a title almost suggests that the work is about something, which in turn affects how we interpret it. By taking that away, it can mean whatever you want it to mean.
