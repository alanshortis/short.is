Someone felling the tree at Sycamore Gap for... I don't know. Do they even know? It's about the most moronic form of vandalism I can imagine. How would it even be punished? Breaking a window or even burning down an ancient building leaves the option of what was destroyed being replaced or recreated, but a 300 year old tree is just gone forever.
