My [previous skepticism](/daily/177) about Roger Waters' re-recording of Dark Side of the Moon was unfounded.

As long as you treat it as an entirely separate entity and not as a replacement or competitor to the original, and you try not to think about the William Shatner comparisons, it works extremely well as a modern interpretation of the album from an 80 year-old who wrote the original at 30.

It's very good. But I understand the criticism that's been cast at it. Covering what's arguably the most recognisable album of all time is bold.
