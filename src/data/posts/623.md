**Thee Silver Mt Zion Orchestra, The Scala, London, [30th April 2007](https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/a-silver-mt-zion/2007/scala-london-england-3bd9587c.html), Â£15.00**

Seventeen years ago, so I can't remember a great deal about this show. The Scala is a small venue, with the audience being all the up to the stage. I have been a balcony dweller for a while, and this was no different.

This is before the ubiquity of phones, and as such the audience was silent for most of the performance, in particular during [BlindBlindBlind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_S-A3GrBm4) where the last few minutes are a cappella. There probably wasn't a dry eye in the room.

If you like music that sounds like it's retelling an apocalypse, this is for you.
