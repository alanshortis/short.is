I think I have seen The Sopranos end-to-end close to a dozen times. This time, I am watching with someone who has never seen it before so it's pretty fascinating to their reactions.

The world is different and the show has become legendary and spawned a whole genre of TV in the 16 or so years since I saw the finale live.

She is picking up on things so much faster than I did, joining dots I didn't until repeat viewings. It's like watching in turbo mode.
