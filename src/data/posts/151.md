I don't know how I feel about new text based AI tools. I think they have vast potential, and the speed at which they can produce coherent-looking content is pretty remarkable, but it does feel as if at this point there is a need for the person writing the prompt and adjudicating the output still needs a good understanding of the subject to separate the what's good from what's nonsensical.

There is also the ethical issue. What exactly has the AI been trained on? GitHub's Copilot bases solutions on code within Github. Does it take the licensing of that code into account? Does it matter? If what the AI produces is based on existing content, how long until training material for AI was AI generated and the production of new ideas starts to stagnate? When I was at school maths teachers would always say 'you won't always have a calculator in your pocket'. Is that going to pivot to 'you won't always have an AI in your pocket'?

I have been resistant to taking it all seriously but I'm now wondering if that makes me one of those people in the 90s who thought the internet was a stupid fad.

So, let's have ChatGPT write a post for me.

### Prompt

Write a blog post in the style of https://short.is/daily

5 Tips for Staying Focused While Working from Home

Working from home has its benefits, but it can also be a source of distraction. Here are some tips to help you stay focused and productive while working remotely:

- Create a designated workspace. Having a designated area for work can help separate your work life from your home life and create a sense of professionalism.
- Set a schedule. Establishing a routine and sticking to a schedule can help you stay on track and avoid procrastination.
- Eliminate distractions. Identify the things that distract you and find ways to eliminate them. This can include closing unnecessary tabs on your computer, turning off notifications, or using noise-canceling headphones.
- Take breaks. It's important to take regular breaks to recharge and refresh your mind. Try to take a short walk, do some stretching, or even just step away from your computer for a few minutes.
- Communicate with your team. Regularly checking in with your team can help you stay on task and also provide a sense of accountability.

Working from home can be a challenge, but by following these tips, you can stay focused and productive. Remember to be kind to yourself and be flexible with your approach.
