title: 'On coffee'
---

A high east London occurrence. Take a walk with someone for work for a chat, and they want to go to a specific place for coffee. As a non-coffee drinker, I don't really care where we go. We get there, they order what they want, and it's at this point I make the mistake of asking if they serve any teas.

The barista looks at me as if I have just taken a shit on the counter or personally offended a close family member.
