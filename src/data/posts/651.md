**TOOL, Brixton Academy, London, [12th May 2002](https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/tool/2002/brixton-academy-london-england-4bd617ae.html), Â£17.50**

My 4th time seeing TOOL, so I knew what to expect. Except this time, Danny walked out before they even dropped the lights and started the into to Ticks and Leeches. This was just the start of a flawless setlist, with everyone absolutely on point. This was one of those few shows that left me feeling something.

I would pay handsomely to see them in this venue again. As the production has grown, with lasers and a vast LED screen, the sound and intimacy has disappeared. I may be one of the very few TOOL fans who isn't rabid about the idea of them playing the Las Vegas Dome. But who knows.
