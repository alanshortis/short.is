When watching Armstrong and Pantani ride away from their competitors around the turn of the century I wanted to believe it was real. Surely the cancer survivor and a legitimate national hero wouldn't cheat, right?

Watching Pogaƒçar puncture and crash at a the bottom of a climb, end up 25 seconds off the back of the peloton, and then ride back to the front, attack, and win by around 25 seconds is something I want to believe is legit, again.

Ironically, the same climb was the scene of Pantani falling foul of a mechanical at the bottom before riding back through everyone and winning.
