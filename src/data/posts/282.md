There is a strange sub-set of people who work in the service industry: waiters, bar staff, and concierges who almost have a contempt for the people they serve if they don't fit a certain criteria.

I experienced it when I was in my 20s and attempted fine dining, and I got it today while getting a drink a hotel bar before catching a train.

Maybe I look more like I belong in a travelodge bar, and that's absolutely fine. It's all the same drinks in a slightly less curated room.
