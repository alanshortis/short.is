title: 'On field recordings'

Let's do a quick week on hobby ideas that I never quite realised.

In the early 2010s I lived in Hackney Wick and would take an early overground train each morning to get to soho for work. most mornings a long and heavy freight train would roll through and I started to record it. Just with my phone, but it sounded good. This extended to recording buskers and trains entering tube stations.

I occasionally listen back to them, and this led me to buy a small field recorder a couple of years ago with the intention of recording each city I visit.

The recordings I got were not good, mostly because of misunderstanding the equipment and falling foul of the sensitivity and no-harness sound which is very different to a phone.

I'd like to come back to this, and share the recordings. It's very noticeable how different cities sound. In the fugitive it takes them a stupid about of time to recognise the sound of Chicago from a phone call, as if the L doesn't sound like nothing else.
