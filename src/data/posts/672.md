**Primus, Toronto, 30th June 2020, $32.23**

If the date didn't give it away, this show never happend. Early enough into the covid years to have been cancelled and yet still have a physical ticket.

This would have been my 23rd Les Claypool show in the fourth country, and on this tour they were set to play the entirety of 'A Farewell to Kings' by Rush.

The ticket states 'Rain or Shine', but not 'Global Pandemic'.
