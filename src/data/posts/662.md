My preferred turntable is the Technics 1210. With DJing and scratching being in the hobby graveyard (though this was a little more successful than most, in that I played in a new London venues and got real money a few times) I have sold one, along with the Vestax mixer. The one that remains I'll never part with.

The pitch control may seem redundant for home listening but there are a couple of albums I pitch down a few percent, just to drop the mood slightly.
