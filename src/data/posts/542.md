Today I learned that Devil's Advocate was actually a legitimate position in the Catholic church. Maybe this has been common knowledge for everyone for a long time (likely), but I never really pondered the origin of that term despite its prevalent use when discussing projects at work.

In the church, the advocates role was to argue against the canonisation of a saint; looking for evidence of fraudulent miracles and overblown claims of piety. Although the role no longer officially existed at the time, [Christopher Hitchens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z79t5hcgn3w) was called on to speak against the canonisation of Mother Teresa in 2003.
