> Why, Sir, you find no man, at all intellectual, who is willing to leave London. No, Sir, when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford.

Samuel Johnson. It wasn't too long ago that I really agreed with this. While living in London, or having recently left and doing everything I could to get back. My younger self would have been amazed that I get to visit occasionally on my company's dime, but this visit was spent mostly avoiding being there.

Long work days are to be expected, but despite being out the office at 6pm with the freedom to do whatever I'd like, what I did was stay in my room. I couldn't face it, and not that I find the population and transport and navigation overwhelming it's more than the feeling I had some years ago—that the city is a vessel for memories of happier times—that had faded, is now back with a vengeance.

I'm working on shedding those feelings like taking off a cloak. Maybe next time.
