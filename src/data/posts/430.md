Don't be the person getting irritated by boarding groups. Loyalty pays off. Be that lucky person who gets a whole row of economy seats on a night flight. Try not to be too smug about it. Accept that the parents of the crying baby have it worse than you. Use headphones. If you know the robot passport gates don't work for you, don't let the staff talk you into trying them anyway. See a border guard.
