There is already a feeling of winding down from some people at work, already Christmas jumpers, and lights up in town.

Last Christmas was the first I enjoyed for years. This year it'll be back to business as usual; wanting the whole thing to slip by quickly, get into the new year, and start working towards Spring and the best part of the year.

I've been trying to balance buying presents with using retailers who offer a good quantity of points, while also using a card that earns points. This is truly the spirit of Christmas. What's in it for me?
