Being able to weight up cooking and then cleaning up the kitchen, and just ordering some garbage from a nearby restaurant that will arrive late and cold is an aspect of modern life I'd like to opt out of.

Why don't have have Diners, like the USA? A comfortable but relaxed place with a vast menu of average quality food for not much money. Greasy spoon cafes exist, but that's a morning/breakfast thing. Let me add a third option: ok food in a different environment.
