You leave your house, on which you paid tax, and get in your car, which was taxed, fill it with fuel, which is heavily taxed, to go to some shops to spend some of your salary, which was taxed, and pay 20% tax on whatever you get. Maybe you invest some of what's left and pay capital gains tax on any profit.

You can pay for a phone call to your GP to be told that you can't get an appointment, call the police if someone breaking into your car to be told they won't do anything about it, head to hospital for an emergency to be told it's a 4 hour wait, and then drive home on roads so utterly fucked you might be paying some tax on repairs.
