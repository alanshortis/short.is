Quoting Fight Club is not a good thing. It falls very neatly into into a category of films where awful people become heroes. You don't have to be extremely online to find people who think Phoenix's Joker or Patrick Bateman are people to aspire to be.

'The things you own end up owning you' is one quote from Fight Club that I have been feeling recently. My car feels heavy. All the crap in my house feels like a burden. OK, not all of it. But things like bikes and books and reminders of old hobbies or the past could all vanish and I wouldn't miss them.
