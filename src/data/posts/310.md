Some of the reaction to the Titan submarine breaking up has been predictably nasty. People thinking that because those on board were rich, they deserve no sympathy and that they in some way bought it on themselves.

It's entirely possible to believe, as I do, that:

- Billionaires shouldn't exist
- Disaster tourism is a bad thing
- The plight of migrants trying to cross oceans for a better life deserves more attention and action

At the same time as:

- Feeling sorry for the victims
- Feeling sorry for their families
- Thinking the news coverage is justified, as this is an unprecedented event
