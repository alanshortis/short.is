We are mammals, and mammals are much more sedate in the winter. Conserving energy, huddling together in groups for warmth and protection, all that stuff. Dumb humans ramp up the pressure with Christmas and New Year and still expect ourselves to be productive.

Alright, so I have a gas bill (for heating) and jackets (for wearing) and tea (drinking, usually) and Wolves don't but please let me have the downtime.

We're in that period where we coast to Christmas; work is still a thing the expectations are so low I can put more time into various mint-infused chocolates than JavaScripting.
