Travel tip: If you're visiting a larger, more metropolitan city you can quickly figure out where the nicer parts of town are by looking at the location of Aesop stores.

I had to pick up some shaving gel today and was given some tea, a handful of samples, and a cloth bag. They also offered to spray the bag with a fragrance of my choice, which I very much declined.

Not every Aesop product I have tried has been amazing, but some of them really are and I'm one of those people influenced by the aesthetic of the packaging and store space. It's just a shame I can't quite have everything in my bathroom matching. Like that even matters.

Sometimes I really don't like who I am.
