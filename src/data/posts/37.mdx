When it's the last working day before some time off, with the added need to be done by a specific time slightly earlier than usual, you can bet there will be weird issues to work around and diagnose.

Two issues, neither of them actually caused by my own work, yet blocking my work from moving forwards took me right up to the end of the the day and beyond. Having a loose thread going into a break isn't what I'd hoped for.
