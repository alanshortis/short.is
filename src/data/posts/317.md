Times I have climbed Snowdon:

- **1996?**. 13, with my Dad, Pyg track.
- **2006**. Crib Goch. I won't be doing that again.
- **2007**. Ranger path. Didn't quite make it to the top because of waist deep snow.
- **2007**. Rhyd Ddu path. The day after, less snow, horizontal icicles at the top.
- **2007**. Up the miner's track, and around the whole horseshoe. Solo trip, fell and knocked myself out on a rock, which was a bit silly.
- **2021**. Rhyd Ddu path. On a whim. Tough. Cloudy.
- **Today**\*. Rhyd Ddu path. On a whim. Tough. Clear all the way up, cloudy at the summit. My knees may never recover.

\* Yes, I caved and went on a quick trip to Wales despite saying I wouldn't. I'm weak (and not just my knees).
