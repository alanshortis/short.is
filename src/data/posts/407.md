title: 'On work'

I don't know what the alternative word is, but describing photos or paintings as 'work' seems weird to me. I know it's more aligned with work-of-art than soul-crushing-drain-on-my-entire-life but still.

It's like being asked what your dream job is; no thank you, I do not dream of labour. Even travelling the world to eat amazing food with fantastic people wasn't enough to save Anthony Bourdain.
