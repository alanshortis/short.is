Columbo has always been my TV detective of choice. You see the murder up front, you know who did it, and the entire episode is given over to watching Columbo figure out what we already know. Poirot is not that.

My friend Frankie is mildly obsessed with Poirot and co-hosts a podcast that analyses every episode, so on her recommendation I watched [Problem at Sea](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0676186/), then listened to her [episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1dvITOm0VBAr7wrU2P7kN9?si=618af8dfe4d04219) immediately after.

The murder does not take place until more than half way through, and we're as in the dark as anyone else and get all the same clues as the Belgian detective himself.

The climax of this episode is pretty creepy, but I didn't see the solution at all. What Poirot offers that Columbo doesn't so much is repeated viewing. Once you know some details you can't help but go back to see what he saw. And it's always there.

69 more episodes to go. Nice.
