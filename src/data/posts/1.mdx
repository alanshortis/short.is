I've done daily writing before. I made it well over 100 days. Then I stopped.

For some reason I thought that keeping it private until I reached a very long streak was the way to go, but that lack of any kind of accountability is what killed it for me. During the second lockdown I became very apathetic and this was one of the casualties. I didn't even keep the old posts, so this is very much a clean slate.
