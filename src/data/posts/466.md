If alcohol was newly discovered, it would without doubt be a controlled class A substance. It does huge damage, massively impairs judgement, and is highly addictive. And it's the centrepiece of so many social occasions.

In the same way that I appreciate religious buildings for their architecture and history, I really like an old pub or dive bar. Even if I'm not selling the poison on sale.
