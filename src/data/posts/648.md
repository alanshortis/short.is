Now I'm using a digital camera I have much more freedom to play with what I am doing.

This is the first time I have had a camera that stops down to f2; the medium format cameras I preferred would go as low as f5.6, and the style I was after worked better with the majority of the scene exposed. While f2 isn't going to provide vast amounts of bokeh, it's enough to make sharp focus a challenge and for layering to be something I need to think about a little more.

I miss the 6:7 aspect ratio of my Fuji medium format camera. I don't mind what full-frame digital gives me for landscape orientation, but I find the height a bit awkward. I don't know why, but on film I felt as if the ratio that camera shot was something I should retain. This feeling isn't there for digital, and I'm going to be cropping any portrait photos to 3:4.
