Photography YouTube is exhausting. A video proclaiming a camera to be amazing, another video from the same person some time after explaining why it's actually not. Why Leica cameras are amazing, why Hasselblad's new camera is amazing (dropping on the day the embargo is lifted, obviously), alongside someone telling us why they're overrated. Video titles that say 'you're wrong' or 'you're doing it wrong'. Montages of someone taking the same photos of abandoned buildings with that same stock music you've heard in 800 Casey Neistat videos.

I'd like to find more channels in the style of [Bryan Birks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ukwG9kYqWI), where the quality of the work is outstanding and it's not just a pursuit of equipment and pixel-peeking.
