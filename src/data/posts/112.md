Constantly getting interested in new things that I will pour attention into before abandoning it. Today: Horology. It's taking massive will power to not buy watch-making tools and old mechanical watches to work on. Fascinated with jewels-as-bearings, watch movements, crowns, and keyless works.

I need to obsess over something cheaper.
