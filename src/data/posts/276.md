Before any social situation I have already rehearsed everything. I've imagined conversations, thought about answers to possible questions, and given myself a pep talk on not talking too much but also not talking too little and making sure I ask people questions about them and not talk about myself enough.

A while ago, someone innocently asked me 'How are you?', and before answering I had to quickly process if this was time time for the long-winded honest answer or the socially acceptable short answer.

Why am I like this?
