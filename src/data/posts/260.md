Dating apps are pure hell. No one really wants to be there, you get judged on essentially nothing and are forced into doing the same to other people.

There was a time where if people met online they'd concoct some story to avoid telling people that it was the internet that bought them together. It now feels as if meeting someone in the real world is far more weird. With remote work and general alienation being so much more commonplace, that organic means of meeting good people is more rare than ever. Imagine approaching someone cold in a pub. Imagine being in a pub.

In any case, if you go into any form of dating with a crippling lack of self worth, it's not going to work. Why would that person be at all interested in someone like me? \*swipes left\*
