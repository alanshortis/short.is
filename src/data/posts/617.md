title: 'On pushing my luck'

In the last couple of months I have seen the flash of a speed camera and received no fine.

The first, I was literally 1 mph over the threshold and it was 1am, so I think it may have been a human decision to not proceed with a fine. The second was thanks to my favourite feature of the smart motorway; a 40 limit on a single gantry with national speed limit either side. With other vehicles around me I couldn't brake hard enough to be completely below the limit. I think what saved me on that occasion was a truck between me and the camera itself.

'Third time lucky' doesn't apply when the first two times were lucky. It'll be lucky for whoever pockets the fine, so there is more speed limiter in my future.
