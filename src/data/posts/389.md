Today may well be a front runner for 'best day'.

- Wake up at Heathrow, breeze through security
- Possibly the most delicious gammon and eggs in an extremely nice lounge
- Plane, lamb for lunch, Godfather Part II included in the entertainment
- Easy train ride into Manhattan
- Caught the very end of the [unveiling of Beastie Boys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1SElsaRiec) Square, at Ludlow and Rivington
- Hotel check-in, except it's a fully functional apartment that's larger than my first flat in Nottingham. Easily big enough to live in
- Nap
- [Emmet Cohen Trio](https://emmetcohen.com/) at Birdland, with steak and a glass of Malbec
- Walk from Midtown, back to my hotel near Battery Park

I am quite incredibly lucky.
