I'm convinced that the jargon and misleading language used in finance are deliberately chosen to keep people (me) away or to force people (me) to give money to a financial advisor who can explain it to people (me) like they're (I am) five years old.

What are fairly simple processes and consequences can be boiled down into some fairly easy to understand language: The tax man will snuff out any excitement you may feel in an instant.
