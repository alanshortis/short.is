title: 'On the week/weekend paradox'

Friday afternoon is a weird time of the week. I am excited for a long and tiring week of work to be over (my team and I delivered a really nice feature, from conception to completion, within 2 weeks that was unplanned), but the moment I shut down my work machine I am confronted with a weekend that I don't really want.

I almost certainly won't see anyone, I will almost certainly feel as if I have wasted it, and I'll still dread Monday despite it marking the end of the 48 hours of uncertainty.
