Really feeling the back-to-work dread today. I only took the weekends and bank holidays off around Christmas and New Year but it's been enough of a break to really talk myself out of what I do, or rather, my ability to do it.

I used to love being a web developer and I used to be good at it, but that feeling has been lacking over the last six months or so. I can't place why it is, but I'm hopeful that a focussed new project and improvements to my non-work life will help.
