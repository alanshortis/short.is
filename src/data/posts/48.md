I'm not really that into classical music, despite running that section in an HMV for a while some 17 years ago (I liked running Dance & Urban more; back then, we could order pretty much whatever we wanted, so the people of Essex had a huge range of [Anticon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticon) and [Big Dada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dada) to choose from) but when I find something I like, I _really_ like it.

The [Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra](https://youtu.be/IH-zp9LjiEs) rendition of Tchaikovsky's 6th Symphony never fails to put a lump in my throat, especially when a single tear drops from the conductor's eye after the finale. You'd have to be made of stone to not feel something.

Then there is Rachmaninov's [The Isle of the Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbbtmskCRUY), probably the most metal piece of music of all time. No metal band could make something this dark, though Godspeed You! Black Emperor get close with [The Dead Flag Blues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGKc3T7OVHE).
