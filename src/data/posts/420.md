My self worth is so absolutely broken I can occasionally come across as rude or aloof. I'm not avoiding talking people because I think I don't need to talk to them or that I'm somehow better than them, I'm avoiding it because I can't image why anyone would want to spend their time on me, and I have a strong sense that I am bothering them.

And yet, there are times where I am very sure I am correct and can be a little hard-nosed about it. Being correct is fine, you can't just tell someone they're wrong without qualifying it in some way. I need to work on that.
