You'd think that a connection between Chas Hodges (of Chas and Dave) and Eminem (of Eminem) would be either impossible or have a lot of steps, but it's just one.

[I Got The](https://youtu.be/xKISdd2mKzU?si=6SMX4GkhCEMNZIzj) by Labi Siffre features Chas on guitar, and was sampled by Dr Dre for [My Name Is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNPnbI1arSE), for Eminem.
