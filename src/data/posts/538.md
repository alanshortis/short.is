Whosampled has a took to find 6 degrees of separation between two given artists. I checked this for Les Claypool and Cory Wong, and the [reasonably tenuous connection](https://www.whosampled.com/six-degrees/search/?artist1=Les+Claypool&artist2=Cory+Wong) includes King Crimson and Fat Boy Slim.

A less demonstrable connection and one that is entirely subjective is that their live performances vastly exceed their studio work. This is true for them both as solo artists and in their respective bands. The energy and improvisation needs a live setting to come out, and by performing in this way night after night the music will naturally evolve into something a little more special.
