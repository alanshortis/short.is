title: 'On post-its'

Kanban is a process management technique that uses sticky notes to represent tasks in a project. It originated in Japan, where it was used in manufacturing to improve efficiency. The idea is simple: write down each task on a sticky note and place it on a board. As the task progresses, move the sticky note to the next column.

It's used in software engineering teams a lot, even in teams (like mine) that aren't very good at organising this kind of thing. Instead we have an endless loop of complaints about Jira and how Linear is going to change our lives (it will not).

The purpose is just to have a method for showing what tasks are where, in a place that everyone can access. That's it.

Before all the software in a time before working remotely, the teams I worked in would have a physical board with real post-its. The old man in me has started to do this to document what I need to do over the weekend, with chores and non-chores written down and tackled, and throwing the note away is part of it.

It has not changed my life.
