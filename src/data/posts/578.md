The 5th Avenue and 53rd Street subway station in New York currently has large parts of the MTA design standards on display in place of any advertising. It's a beautiful and truly iconic piece of design, but I can't allow the irony to go unchecked.

So much of the standards manual refers to clarity of information and communication, but anyone who had used the New York subways knows that understanding how the system works, knowing where you are once you're on a train, and finding the right platform (or track) is far from straightforward.
