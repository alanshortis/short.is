I'm at that tricky moment of a project where I'd like to be able to start again from scratch. I feel as if I could built it in a cleaner, concise, and robust way.

A common note for writers is to do a rewrite of a book or script. It's as if that first run through helps to iron out the issues and get the whole arc straight.

No chance for this project.
