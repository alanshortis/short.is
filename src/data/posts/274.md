I'd like to have a word with whoever decided to add Shorts to YouTube. I like YouTube a lot, enough to pay for Premium. The long-form content is such extraordinarily high quality that for me it's far better value than Netflix.

I don't have Instagram anymore, so Reels are out. I've never had TikTok, so everything that happens there is out of my reach. Except it gets cross-posted to YouTube now, and I'm too weak to not watch 35 bullshit, vapid wastes of bytes in a row.

I can't choose between these two candidates for the worst genre:

- An American observing how weird things are in the UK
- 'Here is [some common knowledge] that I guarantee you didn't know'
