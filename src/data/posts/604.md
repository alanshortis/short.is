In a world where the Hasselblad or Fuji X-pan cameras, that expose across two 35mm frames for for a super wide image, cost a least Â£4,000 without a lens and whose vintage electronics could die with no hope of repair, I have been thinking about another way to get that look.

Anamorphic lenses can be had that do not cost the earth and fit digital bodies that are just about on the correct side of expensive. Shooting a weirdly squashed image through the lens and then 'fixing' it in post will get that super wide image and that unmistakeable anamorphic look; the horizontal lens flares, the oval bokeh, the distortion that looks a little other worldly.
