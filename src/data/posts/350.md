I'd love to be able to read theories on TV shows without the constant hunt for meaning and foreshadowing. Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul are terrible for this; so many die hard fans cannot accept that things happen that don't mean anything. When there are proven theories that the colour of clothing reflects the wearers mental state, there is no limit to the imagined parallels.

The Sopranos does this so well. Thing happen that have no meaning, and storylines end with no real resolution. Just like real life.
