I'm watching Rocky for the first time, and it is quite incredibly boring. Its takes an hour for the inciting event, where Rocky is told that he'll have the chance to fight Apollo Creed. That's when the training montages and passages that people think of when they try and claim it's one of their favourite films finally get underway. Until then, it's extremely drawn out character development which could have been summed up by Mickey telling him what he thinks of him across a packed gym.

And just to remind us it's the 70s, we also have the reluctant love interest who seems to magically fall for our hero after he forces a kiss onto her.
