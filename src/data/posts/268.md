A lot of design work has filled my work days recently, and it's so extremely difficult yet satisfying. Being able to take concepts and put them into a coherent map that illustrates exactly what the user is going to see and work with is amazing. Being able to justify decisions beyond what I think is correct is the aspect of the job that I think will keep me from making the switch.

I can take an existing concept and build on it. I can come up with a concept that feels right. But fresh ideas that are not derivative and need to be evidenced, proven, and sold? IS that a skill I could learn?
