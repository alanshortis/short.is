What does it mean to be creative now? How many people are genuinely making something new, and not just a derivation of something that came before? So much design in the early 2000s, from the likes of of Designers Republic, was just taken from Japan. Apple products look like Braun products.

A lot of street photographers are trying to recreate that mood pioneered by the likes of Ernst Haas, except now it's easier than ever to capture that perfect photograph.

I think I might draw the line at using AI to create images, though. I can't deny that there is some skill in crafting a prompt that steers things in the right direction, but is this now too far removed from whatever creativity means?
