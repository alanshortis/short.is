title: 'On gaming'

Hobbies are incompatible with how my brain works. Somehow I end up watching several hours of YouTube videos on City Skylines II (which does not run on a Mac) which leads me to research on a PC that can run it, obvious disappointment because of how fucking absurd gaming PCs look (RGB LEDs are not it), and before too long it's going to cost a fortune to build a pretend city.

Then the words 'pretend city' lead to me considering gaming to be non-productive and that forms with the money into some kind of guilt Voltron.
