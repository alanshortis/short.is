Getting less for more money is a particular characteristic of some high end products. You might have a special edition car which has been stripped of comforts like air conditioning, carpet, and a radio in order to save weight. This might be paired with a little more power and updated suspension but ultimately you get a lot less for a lot more money.

Leica make the M10-D which is a digital camera with no screen. There is no onboard way to view, edit, curate, or delete any of the photos you have taken. The first opportunity to see the photos is when you upload them to your computer, so you get the feel and experience of shooting film without the chemicals and waiting. Of course the regular M10 which has all the features you would expect from a digital camera is less expensive.
