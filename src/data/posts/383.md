It's just not happening today. I have ideas, but everything I hate tried to write about has been a massive struggle. Last week of work was intense, with long days and plate spinning, the team changing, and going a long way down the wrong path and realising my mistake last thing on a Friday.

I very nearly worked on Saturday to try and get ahead, but I am just about climbing out from under a heavy bag of burnout and I have no desire to crawl back under.

So instead, in letting YouTube do its thing, I learned that Michael Imperioli owns a guitar whose neck was made from wood pulled from the Chelsea Hotel during renovation. Not something I needed to know, but I like that I now know it.
