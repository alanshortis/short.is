title: "On perks I don't want"

Every Wednesday the office has a free lunch. It's a perk everyone loves and the food always comes from a local place so there is always something new to try.

But none of that is enough for me to stand in line for 20 minutes. Office time since the lockdowns has been weird; I get a lot of work done but I know hardly anyone and have become useless at striking up conversation.
