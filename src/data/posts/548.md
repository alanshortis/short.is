Any memories before around 16 years old are gone. The only way I seem to be able to unlock anything is via direct association, and even then it's fairly hazy.

Like a lot of workplaces, some meetings with unfamiliar attendees start with an ice breaker question and not too long ago that question was 'what's your earliest memory?'. Sadly, I wasn't the only person to have a hard time coming up with an answer, and worse for some, the answer they did have was a traumatic event.
