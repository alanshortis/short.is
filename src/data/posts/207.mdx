You can't really confront someone when they are holding scissors and they could leave you with half a hair cut. I just won't be going back after they referred to Gary Lineker as a 'radically left woke liberal snowflake' who should 'shut up and do the football'.

Funny how his argument 'I'm not paying for his opinions' kind of applies to him too. Stick to the usual haircut repertoire of holidays and work and phones and, ironically, football.
