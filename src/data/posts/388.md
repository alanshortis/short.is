If a Swiss Army Knife really was designed for the Swiss Army, what sort of thing is the Swiss Army doing where it would be appropriate for the Swiss Army to be opening bottles of wine with their Swiss Army Knives?

Unless there is some other use for a corkscrew that I am unaware of, I have to assume it's to get the cork out the barrel of brandy placed around the neck of their St Bernard rescue dogs.
