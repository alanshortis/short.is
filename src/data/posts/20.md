I need to zone the house. Having really vague demarcation between rooms (the kitchen and bathroom aside) is definitely making my sleep, work, and relaxing time worse because there is so little context applied to each area those things happen in.

Sleep is pretty easy. I'm going to remove everything but my alarm clock from the bedroom and leave my phone elsewhere overnight so it's not the first and last thing I hold every day. Work and relaxation is harder; the space available means these have to happen in the same room, so I'm going to need something else to make that contextual shift.

I'm not above rewarding myself for managing to work consistently for a set period of time. It works for dogs.
