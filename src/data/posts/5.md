title: 'On bragging'

Imposter syndrome is a hell of a thing. Doing something near daily for more than a decade cannot defeat the doubt that comes in from a temporary loss of passion, shaky knowledge of the new, and such a crippling fear of making a mistake I choose to procrastinate and make everything ultimately worse.

Doing the scary things and seeing a positive result is the best remedy, but seeing that in the moment is nearly impossible. I recently learned about [Brag Documents](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/). You note down all the great stuff you do as you do it so as not to forget. While it's intended to help with performance reviews I think I can see it helping when reviewed in times of doubt, and fostering a 'I know I can do this' attitude.

Now I just need to gain the confidence to feel ok with bragging.
