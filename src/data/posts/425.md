I generally shy away from the tourist traps, but make an exception for observation decks in tall buildings. Empire State, Rockefeller Centre, Sears (sorry, 'Willis') Tower, John Hancock Center, CN Tower, Shart (sorry, 'Shard'), Eiffel Tower.

I would like to be able to teleport to the top of the Burj Kalifa, then teleport back again so I can be a kilometere in the air without having to go to Dubai.
