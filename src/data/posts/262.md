I work up today (Friday) absolutely convinced it was Saturday. What shall I do? I know I need to do some work on the bikes, as the weather is turning. F1 qualifying is on later, and the Giro d'Italia starts today too.

Oh what? Friday? A whole work day, a new product to release (and the inevitable flood of questions, some nice, some pretty fucking rude actually). At least I'm pre-prepared for my Saturday.
