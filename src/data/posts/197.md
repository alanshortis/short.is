100 miles on the M1, these are some of thie dumb thoughts I had:

- How heavy is the M1?
- How many bridges cross it?
- Who is doing the shortest journey?
- Who is doing the longest?
- How many trees are there in the UK?
- In the world?
- How much did that number change between starting and finishing my thought?
- Is anyone on this road listening to the same music as I am?
- Oh shit was that a speed camera?
- I hate smart motorways. Why is there a 40 limit right now?
