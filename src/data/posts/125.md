With a subscription, YouTube is easily one of the best places to go on the internet. Without a subscription, it's one of the worst.

I been a subscriber for a long time, but I've let it lapse to see if I can do without. It's quickly become horrible to use, showing over a minute of adverts that couldn't be skipped before a video I wasn't even certain I wanted to watch.

I cannot stand advertising. It's loud (by design), obnoxious, usually treats people as if they're stupid, and while I think it doesn't work on me I have been thinking about M&M's ever since my advertising purgatory earlier on.
