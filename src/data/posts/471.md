With minimal research, I can learn that a particular Leica lens is of very high quality. And some of them are available and reasonably priced. Nice.

Deeper research reveals that in the 70 years it's been in production, there have been several versions. The one I can afford is considered the worst, with more contrast and the expense of sharpness. This might have been an aesthetic choice for the 1070s but it's not it. Give me pastel tones and pin sharpness.
