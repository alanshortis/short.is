Is it normal to be able to pinpoint the best and worst day of your life? People refer to their wedding or birth of their kid as the best as a matter of routine, but I don't have either of those and likely never will. And doesn't that answer feel a little stock? Maybe it actually is that good.

What I do know: My 'best day' featured someone I'm no longer in touch with, and my worst day featured a truck driver doing the globally recognised sign language for 'wanker', so take from that what you will.
