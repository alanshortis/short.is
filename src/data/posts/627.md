If you have recommend a film, TV show, or music to me and I haven't watched or listened yet, please know that it's not because I don't trust your taste or judgement. Far from it.

It's more that I am in a phase of watching or listening to things I know well because doing so is comforting. Somehow, knowing the lines from the next scene helps to alleviate some of the stress of the previous day, or week, or longer.
