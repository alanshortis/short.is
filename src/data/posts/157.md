I used to occasionally work in a warehouse in Canning Town. A couple of times a year I'd spend a few days processing and organising thousands of DVDs so that when they arrived at the store I worked in it would take much less time to shelve it and be ready to sell.

The closest place for food was a pub. One of those pubs in the middle of an industrial estate that was only open at lunch time and only frequented by factory workers getting drunk before spending the afternoon operating heavy machinery. They had table dancers on Tuesdays.
