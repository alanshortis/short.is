The only surprising thing is that I am surprised. Sunak (our third Prime Minister in 12 months) gave a speech today in which gloated about Northern Ireland being in the position of having access to the EU single market AND UK trade being an extremely good thing.

Apparently neither he nor his team realised you cannot claim Brexit is a good thing for the UK while simultaneously claiming the exact opposite for Northern Ireland. We had that, for all four nations. And they blew it all up for the sake of a close-call referendum with demonstrable misinformation from the leave side, and, for the sake of balance, incompetence and complacency from remain.

The irony of all of this is that Brexit has made me want to leave the UK, but makes it much more difficult. If we were still in the EU, I'd probably be less keen to move abroad but it would be much easier.
