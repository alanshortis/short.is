Night drive observations:

- I saw a cat properly use a zebra crossing
- [Antipop Consortium - Tragic Epilogue](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_cAECHybdz35TilKZpIGpBiZgVrpTzzY) is the best album for night drives
- The closer you get to the middle of a city, the more scooters and probably-not-legal Deliveroo e-bikes outnumber any other vehicle
- People on scooters with no lights dressed entirely in black
- It's extremely relaxing
- I can think of nothing at all or mull over a specific problem. This doesn't seem to be a choice though, it just goes one way or the other
