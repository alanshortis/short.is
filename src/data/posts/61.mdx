The combination of having had a lot of hobbies but also being frequently broke and needing to sell possessions leaves you with a lot of eBay and Gumtree experience, but also a regular feeling of alarm at the current-day prices of things once sold.

Turntables, film cameras, bikes with rims brakes, cymbals with a distinctly 90s sound. All things that don't get manufactured anymore.
