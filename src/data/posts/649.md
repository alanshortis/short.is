There is only this moment. The past cannot be changed, and no amount of regret can alter it. Pining for a past that wasn't is a waste. Failing to think about the future is a betrayal to yourself.

Living in the moment is great for you. It's not great for you in the future. It's hard to think about decisions that have long term benefits but short term discomfort.
