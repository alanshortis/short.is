Apple are very close to selling me on the Studio Display because it'll mean I can get rid of my current display, a dock, and my webcam. It does all of those things in one neat package.

This is an absolutely needless purchase that I am extremely unlikely to go through with, but the idea of spending more money to have less stuff doing the same thing is irritatingly appealing.
