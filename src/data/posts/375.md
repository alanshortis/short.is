Fairly often I have heard a piece of music I didn't know somewhere public, and totally misinterpreted what's actually happening. Placing the one somewhere totally wrong creates some new pattern that wasn't the intent of the writer.

This happened in a a band once upon a time, and fortunately my band-mates just thought I was doing something different by introducing some time-shift. I owned up to what I was hearing, and no matter how much they tried to explain I couldn't adapt my way of hearing to be correct.
