Haircuts. Someone touches your head and sculpts your hair in a shape that you vaguely described while they put a robe on you.

Football, holidays, beer gardens are the subjects of the day. Until we're saved by a very young boy, maybe 2, who is not happy about his haircut. Screaming his head off, trying to be coerced into allowing some sharp blades near his locks. Conversation is impossible, and everyone reverts to knowing looks.
