There is a theory that the true test of a 'good person' is if they return their shopping trolley. There is no rule that you have to, no reward for doing so, and it's easy to just leave it wherever. Returning it is just the right thing to do.

In Sainsbury's today I watched a couple take something from someone else's trolley (undetected by the trolley owner) because whatever it was they took was 'all the way over the other side'. Objectively a terrible thing to do. But later, I saw the same couple in the car park and they returned their trolley even though they were really far away from the bay.

This probably goes beyond good and bad and just goes all the way to psychotic.
