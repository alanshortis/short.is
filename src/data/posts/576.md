Driving in the USA is easier than driving in the UK.

Being on the opposite side of the car and the road feels totally normal after a few minutes, even if those few minutes are trying to navigate an SUV the size of an aircraft carrier out of a car park and into the streets of Manhattan.

I didn't see a single roundabout in 400 miles, and every junction was wide and easy to navigate. Speed limits on the freeway are officially between 50 and 55 and get no one, not even the trucks, are going any slower than 70.

Lanes are a free for all, and bobbing a weaving between them to get where you're going it totally acceptable. Trucks stay in the middle lane, and everyone else just goes where they want.
