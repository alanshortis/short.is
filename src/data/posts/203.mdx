title: 'On drums and J Dilla'
---

I wish my time playing drums had overlapped with my knowledge of J Dilla. I tended to lean towards precision, but could add some swing when appropriate. That mostly came from studying Jazz in the latter days of my playing.

Dilla Time is neither of those things. Imagine a grid generated to by a computer, and each hit is plotted on that grid. It's going to be perfectly spaced, and maybe a little robotic. Now imagine the same hits plotted on a hand drawn grid. It's kind of the same, but everything is a little off. A little more human.

There isn't really anything stopping me getting back to playing drums, just a taste for expensive cymbals and the impossible choice between Ziljian As and Ks, and Paiste 2002.
