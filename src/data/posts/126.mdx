title: 'On avoidance'
---

I just finished David Goggins' audiobook, and the thread throughout is one of perseverance and facing challenges head on.

Recently I have developed a bad pattern of avoiding tasks that feel like they might be difficult. What I'm really avoiding is a feeling of struggling or potential failure.

Once I've faced up to the task and completed it I feel good. Something I get from daily writing is a moment of reflection and clarity that is missing in the heat of the moment, so right now I know that if I get that good feeling more often I am more likely to use that as a motivator for the next difficult job.
