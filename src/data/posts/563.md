I bought a Gregg's sausage roll (I'm not proud of it, I was hungry). On being asked to take a tray of fresh beige from the oven, the member of staff responded with a loud 'YES CHEF'. The manager rolled their eyes in a way that suggested that this wasn't the first or last time this had happened.

Now holding the tray, a series of 'BEHIND' between the oven and counter completed the Carmy cosplay. Presumably they have appointments for the tattoos and a gym membership for the biceps.
