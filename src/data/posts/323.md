The right to protest and strike is essential, and I would always defend it. It can trigger genuine change and draw attention to real issues.

But I also would like to be able to watch sport without interruption, and without seeing resentment grow among the public for what is a genuine cause. And I'd like to be able to use reliable public transport at a reasonable cost.
