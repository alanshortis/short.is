Free idea of any cinema: Showings where you charge a little more but run no ads and no trailers. The film starts 5 minutes after the advertised time, and if you're not there, tough.

If we could also find a way to not need to listen to people eating Nachos, we can throw that into the deal.

Maybe what I am describing is me staying at home and watching films on my sofa.
