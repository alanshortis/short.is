My regular route into London takes me through St Pancras. The roof still amazes me every time, with twenty five principal arched trusses, each weighing 55 tons. The arch raises to a slight point in the middle which sets it apart.

Like Grand Central Station in New York, a key piece of transport infrastructure becomes a destination in its own right.
