Evidence to support Die Hard being a Christmas film:

- Set on Christmas Eve
- 'Ho Ho Ho' (Now I have a machine gun)
- 'Seasons Greetings' tape (to conceal hand gun)
- Snow (paper falling from the building. 'Artistic license')
- Reporter gets punched (not Christmasy, but definitely festive)
- Closing credits music is 'Let it Snow'
