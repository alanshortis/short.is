**Orbital, Brixton Academy, London, [24th June 2004](https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/orbital/2004/carling-academy-brixton-london-england-73ed9261.html), Â£25**

At around 11 or 12 years old I ended up with a few CDs, and I have no idea where any of them came from Alice in Chains, Porno for Pyros, and Orbital's Snivilisation. It was the first time I recognised a sample in the wild (Two Princes, by Spin Doctors, which I mostly liked because they used a piccolo snare) and upon telling my Dad about it he quickly told me that it was theft.

Somehow ending up right on the rail, the volume was unbearable and watching two men hunched over some hardware wasn't that interesting after a while. We left early.
