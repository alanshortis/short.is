While watching all Paul Thomas Anderson films again, in order, you realise that so many actors return for multiple films in a row. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Daniel Day-Lewis disappear into their characters; while you're looking at a familiar face, you're not seeing them pretending to be someone else.

John C Reilly is great, but it's only really in Magnolia that he comes close to a clear separation. But huge credit to PTA for putting Adam Sandler in Punch-Drunk Love and drawing a truly singular performance.
