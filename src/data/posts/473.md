title: 'On TV remakes of good films'

**Fargo:** The TV series just took the feel from the film (cold, endless winter, small-town personalities) and weaved them into new stories. It's great, even if Martin Freeman is sort of doing a bit of a William H Macy impression.

**High Fidelity:** A bit confusing because they took dialogue directly from the film and modernised it a little. It's set in New York instead of Chicago (which shouldn't matter but really does for reasons I can't/won't explain). Which all makes it feel like a cover rather than a remake (even though 'cover' is a music thing and this is a TV thing but whatever). But it's Zoe Kravitz essentially being the perfect woman in 30 minute chunks so I'm going to finish it.
