Is it possible to just like something for what it is? Enjoying playing guitar while knowing nothing about certain players? When drums were a big deal for me I didn't really care too much about the drummers I was probably supposed to care about, but found some via the music they performed.

I think I might have been better if I could have stomached more than a few minutes of the weird, synthetic jazz-adjacent music that amazing players like Dave Weckl appeared on. Obvious talent and skill but reduced to a technical exercise with a void where the soul should have been.

It's meant to fun.
