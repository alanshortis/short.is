In The Sopranos, Beansie is a friend of Tony's who is paralysed after being run over by Richie Aprile. He owns three pizza parlours.

Around the time these episodes aired, I was living in a house share with some work friends and I remember exactly two details of that time; the house was called San Esteban, and we called our landlord Beansie.
