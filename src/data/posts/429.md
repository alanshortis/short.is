New York and Chicago, both trips featured probably too long staring at a scale model of the city. New York's model is impressive for the vast size and completeness, Chicago's is impressive for being immersive and using projectors to highlight specific buildings when selecting info from a screen.

No I'm not going to decide where to visit based on scale-model availability and quality, and the fact that I have learned that London has once is just a coincidence.
