title: 'On 40s'

I realised today, while pondering yet again the purpose of a mystery section of 40 mph on another smart motorway (seriously, I will never stop being bothered by this), that I spent the entirely of the 30s trying to be in a good relationship.

At 30, while engaged, a two year relationship came to an end. A year or so later I got into another relationship that came to end after around 4 years, which was probably later than it should have ended. A brief 4 month coupling which I regret losing. Then despite the covid lockdowns, a two year relationship came to an end when I was 39. It hit me like of a ton of bricks, but deep down I always knew it would happen. From the very start.

If my 30s were all about me trying to combine my life with someone else's, maybe my 40s should be focussed on definitely not doing that. And besides, I'm not sure I have it in me to place that much trust in another person for the foreseeable.
