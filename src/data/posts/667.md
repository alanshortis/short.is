AI music is reasonably easy to spot right now, but given a couple of years I am certain there will be wildy popular 'artist' whose music and image are entirely owned by a record label and entirely generated by AI.

Large scale tours with holographic performers, all driving sales of merchandise, and all for profit. Multiple crews and stages making for more shows than ever before possible.

In the last 10 years or so a lot of older musicians have sold their entire catalogues to record labels. They get one last massive pay day, and the label gets to do yet another round of rereleases, remasters, and advertising revenue. Te next step will be selling the rights to their image and sound so that AI can keep making music long after they are gone.

A new Beatles album? They already used AI to fill in the blanks on a new single. Don't rule out more of the same once Paul and Ringo are gone.
