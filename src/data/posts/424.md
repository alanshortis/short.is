There are two types of inexpensive hotel: budget chains with 'smart' rooms and all that shit, used to justify a box of a room, and my favourite, the once-grand but now-tired hotel.

Fairly drab decor, but built to last. Marble (probably real) lobbies. A concierge. A large awning out front with a doorman who looks as if he's been there for 30 years (there are probably indents in the pavement that perfectly match his shoes). If it has a Speakman Anystream shower I'll become a lifelong customer.
