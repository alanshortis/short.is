**[The Baby Huey Story / The Living Legend](https://open.spotify.com/album/2lTfjZPS0xFQE3cbGZf92T?si=VcwPxX64SvGAl45WzCqe_Q)**

James Thomas Ramey was better known as Baby Huey. He unfortunately died of a heart attack at 26, but left behind this absolute classic. [Hard Times](https://open.spotify.com/track/7ycU5Bxfn2fIZjXJypfdRM?si=faaea832097e4eaa) is about as cold as it gets.

This is a reissue in a nice gatefold, and inside there are newspaper cuttings mentioning his death as well as the deaths of Janis Joplin and Hendrix. This gets a lot of turntable time.
