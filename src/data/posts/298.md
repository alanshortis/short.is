Having just a small mirror in the bathroom at home means being exposed to full length mirrors in hotel rooms or in the recently-joined gym is a pretty harrowing experience.

Who is this fat old man staring back at me?

Maybe I need to only frequent those clothes shops that have mirrors with a flattering distortion built in so I can keep on imagining that I'm still young and slim.
