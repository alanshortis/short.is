> Everyone has the same 24 hours in a day

No. Not even close to correct. This sounds like a motivational quote to bait people who are all about hustle culture, but it totally ignores people circumstances.

A wealthy, high earning, high achiever. Has someone to clean their house, cook their food, take care of their kids, do their chores and drive them around. Flies business or first or even private, all of which are environments in which it's possible to work and has expedited boarding and security. Almost 100% of their time can be assigned to work or rest.

Average people have to handle everything around their word day. Maybe they can split some chores with a partner or maybe they live alone and have to shoulder everything. In either case, at its origin the 8 hour work day assumed there was someone at home doing the housework, and a family could live on one salary.

So no. We do not all have the same 24 hours in a day.
