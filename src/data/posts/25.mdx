**Book review:** [Lessons in Stoicism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43566091-lessons-in-stoicism), by John Sellars.

This brief book covers the basics of Stoicism, mostly from the the teachings of Marcus Aurelius and Seneca. The general premise of this philosophy is that you cannot control what happens to you, but you can control how you react. There are passages that link to God and Nature-as-God as being a higher power who gives you experiences, and that everything you have is only yours temporarily (just as life itself).

The book is a primer, and I think I'll learn more from the source material of [Meditations](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30659.Meditations) and [Letters from a Stoic](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/97411.Letters_from_a_Stoic). But, reading it on the train, it did help me to not be upset by the person beside me eating an onion sandwich and washing it down with Red Bull.
