Some aspects of the future are hard to change. Work, tax and bad actors. People insisting on making worthless YouTube videos (which I end up watching, so who's the real idiot here?). Tories. People who think Brexit is a good thing.

The answer doesn't lie in the past. Pining for what was is fucking stupid. The present doesn't exist. The future is all there is and most of it is malleable. Make it good, and try to ignore the bullshit.
