When the London Eye has reached the end of its life, they need to incorporate its destruction into the New Year's Eve fireworks display. Each pod exploding, the wheel itself falling forwards into the Thames, maybe a few barges explode too. Why not.

It's inevitable that fireworks will be replaced by drones, but it'd better not happen before the ceremonial destruction of a London landmark.
