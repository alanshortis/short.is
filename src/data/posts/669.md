I have dropped out of more than one interview process for web engineering jobs when the technical assessment focusses strongly on algorithms and leetcode assignments and not at all on user experience and accessibility.

Am I in denial about what it really takes to find jobs now? Do I need to bite the bullet and learn more about algorithms and data structures? I have been doing this a long time and I have never felt the need to know these things. They simply do not factor into the majority of the problems I am solving day to day.

Would it reframe my thinking and change how I approach tasks that are ostensibly unrelated? Would knowing this stuff help to cure my imposter syndrome?
