Good habits propagate good habits. If I eat this bad thing or skip a day of training, it'll make the good food I prepared and ate and the productive gym session less effective.

Bad habits propagate bad habits. If I've eaten poorly and not trained for a few days, one more day won't make any difference.

In both scenarios, it's been many days in a row before you know it.
