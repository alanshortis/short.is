Earn tokens by exchanging your time. Some people get more tokens per-while than others, but this does not correlate with the importance, difficultly, or impact of your your contribution. If you have a lot of tokens, you can use them to make more tokens. If you don't have a lot of tokens, your tokens are only really ever exchanged for goods and services. Almost every time you choose to exchange your tokens, some of them will go to the government and some will go to a bank.

And on it goes, forever.
