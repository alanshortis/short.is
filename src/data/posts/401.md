Getting better at something is all about practice. Just do the thing and you'll better at the thing. Cycling and writing code and taking photos; looking at my ability and wishing I was better while conveniently ignoring how little time I actually spend practicing.

Practicing sitting down watching shit TV makes me more inclined to sit down and watch shit TV.
