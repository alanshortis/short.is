I just don't know if I can keep doing it. Formula is ramping up for a new season and while car launches used to be pretty exciting, it's now just a parade of billboards on the same generic show car.

They cannot show the real car when it launches because it would allow rival teams enough time to study their aero choices before testing begins. Last year Mercedes openly had a fake floor on launch, not that their car had much in the way of pace.

Despite this, pundits will make predictions on the probable pace, finishing positions, and reliability based on absolutely nothing. Whatever it takes to generate those click.

I don't want to slip into that subset of F1 fans that sees the introduction of Drive to Survive as a death knell for the sport, but it hasn't helped. It's a wider issue of social media commentary that needs constant engagement.

A couple of days ago I wrote about how bad social media makes me feel. This is essentially that post again, but with cars.
