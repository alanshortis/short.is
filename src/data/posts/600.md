How many weird 3D printed trinkets and thingers would I make before I got bored of it? I wondered if a small side-project would be print small parts of bikes and cameras. Etsy seems to be have a good amount of sellers making things like hot-shoe covers for cameras, mounts for bike lights, tiny shelves for displaying records.

There is a reason this idea of a hobby was never realised.
