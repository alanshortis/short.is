title: 'On digital pictures of analog things'
---

There are digital images of analog things. Shooting expensive film that has particular characteristics and then scanning it to make it digital and shareable, and getting the particular characteristics of whatever sensor does the scanning, too.

There are analog images of digital things. Putting music originally recorded digitally onto vinyl, making some kind of perceived analogue warmth that was never there in the first place.

Maybe they're both illogical and maybe I'll just keep doing both of these things.
