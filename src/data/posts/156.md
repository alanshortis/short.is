Yes, I have been watching The Apprentice (UK, with Alan Sugar) for years. I know it's terrible, but I liked the rubbernecking-a-car-crash feel of a show that is so obviously staged and crammed with awful people.

This year, three episodes in, I just cannot do it. Next level stupidity, the same formulaic tasks rehashed for another season, and what's with all the horrific make up?

I enjoy high art. I enjoy junk TV. But you've got the draw the line somewhere.
