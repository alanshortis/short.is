title: 'On cluster headaches'

It looks as if I have developed cluster headaches. A behind-the-eyes migraine every day for days on end. This is day 8, but the diagnosis says it should last an hour or two a day. Today it's been 9 hours, so far.

I'm already behind at work and I have no idea how I'm going to keep up a good pace if I need to spend a large part of my day in the dark.

I don't know if this is covid related, but to get two life-long changes from two covid infections feels a little unfair. Poor me, right?
