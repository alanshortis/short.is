I don't play guitar, and I don't really intend to. But part of me still wants to own Gretsch and Fender baritones, a precision bass, or some weird fan-fretted [hybrid](https://hybrid-guitars.com/).

I don't smoke and never have, so why would I like to own a Dupont lighter?

I haven't DJd or scratched for more than 15 years but I still use a Technics 1210 and I still kind of want to own a Vestax mixer.

I'm extremely average photographer who constantly wonders if it's even the hobby for me, but I still lust after Leica and Hasselblad cameras.

Owning objects can add another dimension of enjoyment to a hobby, but without partaking in the hobby in the first place it's just weird misplaced consumerism.
