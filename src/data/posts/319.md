July is a concentration of Formula 1 races in Europe before the summer break, and a full month of cycling with the Tour de France for three weeks and Tour de France Femmes for a week after.

Week days is cycling commentary as the soundtrack to much of my work day and a huge drop in music consumption, weekends is more sofa time than is really healthy with at least two screens to keep up.
