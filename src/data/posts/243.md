If the algorithm only promotes content to people when it thinks there is a good chance it'll be appreciated, it'll leave very little room for truly new ideas.

Music that deviates from some kind of measurable norm or identifiable pattern in someone's listening habits is going to be hard to come by. I don't think Spotify has ever suggested something completely off the wall. I have found great music but it's always in a genre I know, features people I know, or there is some other line from a known artist to an unknown.

As AI and algorithms start to take a bigger hand in the creation and curation of art the cookie-cutter approach is going to proliferate. I think there is a strong chance this will lead to an explosion of art creation and recommendation that is deliberately human-made.
