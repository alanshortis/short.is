title: 'On Six Feet Under'

Six Feet Under is probably my favourite TV show of all time. Some things feel like they come close, but the recency bias skews that significantly. I am also, however, well aware that the nostalgia of my life around Six Feet Under boosts its status.

This scenario almost sounds too good to be true: In the flat of my artist girlfriend, opposite the entrance to Holborn station, and watching the entirely of season 4 on a newly acquired DVD.

I seem to be thinking of these things more and more often. You truly do not realise what you have until it's gone.
