title: 'On The 80s'

I have a Spotify playlist called '80s shit I'm embarrassed to like' (no, I will not share it all here). While there is a lot of questionable music from the 80s, whose quality is greatly diminished by the advent of digital instruments and recording, along with drum machines and push to leave the 70s behind, there is some gold in there.

Proper autotune didn't come about until the 90s, so while the lyrics and video for this [Go West](https://youtu.be/XBZUz4C6kqk?si=126L3Lrmla2qy0L8) song are obviously extremely dated, that vocal performance is pretty nuts, and had to be done for real. I was reminded of this song while trying to find some in a Whole Foods and despite not hearing it for many years prior, I somehow knew all the words.

I don't want to be the old man moaning about music, but I recently saw a YouTube video that broke down what gets played through in-ear monitors for a lot of artists, and as well as hearing themselves and other musicians, it also includes a click track and prompts for the verse/chorus/bridge that's coming up. I get that this is to make sync of the lights, videos, and choreography easier to work with, but it has a bit of a sterile feel.
