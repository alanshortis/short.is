We've been spoiled this year:

- **Succession:** Highly spoiled as it was, it became true event-TV without being watered down.
- **Barry.** The perfect blend of funny, dark, and surreal.
- **Ted Lasso:** While not something I'd ever re-watch, it was a show that embodied kindness as the wave of empathy from the lockdowns finally broke and rolled back.
- **The Bear.** This show is as close to perfect as I have seen. While shows I hold up and 'best ever' begin to sage and lose their edge, this is absolutely blown me away. It has a very good heart, under the chaos and shouting.

I haven't watched **I'm a Virgo** yet, but it's Boots Riley so

I can't not mention **Atlanta**, despite it wrapping up last year. I somehow managed to miss its release entirely, so I saw it this year and it's on the same level as The Bear. I feel every episode rather than just watch.
