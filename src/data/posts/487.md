Attenborough and Morgan Freeman get the accolades in the reassuring and trustworthy voice genre, but a less popular and harder to understand option is Werner Herzog. There is something about his tone that makes me want to listen, even if it's something ostensibly [mad and pretentious](https://youtu.be/Rkv6iZhggTY?si=zKCipu57jMcd6A24).

I'd like him to narrate a day in my office.
