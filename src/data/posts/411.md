It's really sad that so many more liberal people (people who don't think the NHS should ever be privatised) have to prefix any story about using healthcare with 'I love the NHS, but...'.

I absolutely hate what the fucking Tories have done over the last 13 years. Deliberately bringing down support and funding so that targets are missed and service is destroyed, so that at some time in the future they can point to the mess and use it to justify selling it off to private companies and insurance companies.

They try and deny this, of course. They say that it's never been so well funded. While that might be true as a number, it doesn't account for our fucked inflation and patient numbers.

This is a wealthy nation. I shouldn't need to literally say 'please help me' to a GP receptionist to get an appointment that isn't in two weeks, and the alternative shouldn't be Â£80 for a 15 minute appointment with a private doctor excluding any tests.
