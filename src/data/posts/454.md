I have aged into Porsche appreciation. In my younger years I would always think that older men in 911s seemed to lack imagination. Not anymore. There are very few cars still in production that are true design classics.

There is a house I occasionally walk past with two cars on the drive: a 911 Carrera and a Taycan. I think they have unlocked the ultimate 2 car garage.
