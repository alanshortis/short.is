title: 'On not guilty pleasures'

There is a set of music and film that I wouldn't call guilty pleasures but I would never recommend to anyone else.

As much as I love [Mr. Bungle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8-UmsgDU6Q), no one needs to be introduced to them by me. It's just not the sort of music that is fair to inflict on anyone else. The same goes for [Primus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbMhFPI4Us0).

What I do feel guilty about is a playlist I have called '80s shit I shouldn't like'. [Level 42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4m41bBPJvA) and [Go West](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBZUz4C6kqk). For shame.
