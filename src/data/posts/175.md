Of the three drops of Nike Craft Tom Sachs shoes, I have managed to buy exactly zero pairs. Depop and eBay are already awash with resales at many times the original cost; I just wanted to buy them so I could wear them.

So much of fashion, and street wear in particular, is hype-based. Nike don't care if people buy them to sell them on, it just means that the next pair will have even more interest.
