You can de-badge a car to either hide the fact that it's a high end, powerful model or to hide the fact that it's a low-end diesel despite looking like something with more grunt.

I place tape over the make and model on my good cameras, which both happen to be made by Fuji. The result is a pretty nondescript black box that looks like nothing to a casual observer.

Conversely, my Â£30 plastic Holga camera also has it's logo covered. Not to hide what it is, and not with tape, but an embossed Dymo label that reads 'LEICA'.

I have't made a M140i sticker for my shitty diesel car. Yet.
