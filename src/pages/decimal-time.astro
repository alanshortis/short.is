      <p>
        Decimal time (or metric time) emerged during the French Revolution and the broader push toward
        decimalisation of measurement systems. Each day is divided into 10 hours, each hour into 100 minutes,
        and each minute into 100 seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using a base-10 structure you can reduce the time to one number and make calculations and
        conversions simpler. Where we consider the middle of the day to be 12 o'clock in regular time, in
        decimal time it is 5, or 50% of the day elapsed. This makes it possible represent time as progression
        while still representing the time.

        You may notice that each decimal clock on this page suffers from occasional skipped seconds or
        rounding issues. At 60<abbr title="Frames per Second">fps</abbr> we can't evenly divide a decimal second
        (864ms) into whole frames so we are never consistently inside one increment. At some point we miss the
        tick. The conventional clock never misses, since seconds are seconds and frames are frames on the same
        grid.

        Time may be a social construct, but it's so deeply ingrained into society and technology that adoption
        of decimal time is entirely impractical. Existing time pieces become obsolete; both the scale of the
        dial and the velocity of the hands is totally incompatible between systems and it's not possible to
        run both at the same time on the same clock, like two sides of a tape measure comparing inches and
        centimetres.
