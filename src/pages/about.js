          <p>
            Iâ€™m Alan Shortis&mdash;a front end developer based in Nottingham. I like CSS more than
            JavaScript, design systems more than chaos, and accessibility more than exclusion.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a front end developer, I specialise in building user interfaces with HTML and CSS.
            But, it being 2021, I also work extensively in JavaScript, using React on a daily basis
            partnered with GraphQL and Node.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have been a developer professionally in some capacity for more than 10 years, though I
            made my first websites in the late 90s. They were terrible, even by the standards of
            Geocities.
          </p>

          <p>
            My preference for front end development is likely connected to me being a design
            hobbyist who used the internet to show off derivative ideas. Across my career I have
            also worked with Classic ASP, .net, PHP, and SQL in my brief time as an analyst, but
            building accessible user interfaces for people is where I have settled.
          </p>
