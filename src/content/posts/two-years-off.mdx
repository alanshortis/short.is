Proposal: nothing new for two years. No more _new_ approaches to building websites, no more films, books, TV shows, albums, and most importantly no more podcasts. Things that exist can be maintained and iterated, so you can get your new Joe Rogan episodes if that's something you need, but sales of expensive microphones on boom arms in the faces of boring drones with nothing to say will take a hit under this policy. Sorry Shure.

Two years to breathe, finally watch essential movies, that obscure Scandinavian drama, the books gathering dust on your shelves, understand Trout Mask Replica. In software, what we already have will get attention and improvements, the endless reinvention can stop smothering engineers and allow them to make web components and web assembly accepted and wonderful.
