There was a time when you could spend an entire evening just _browsing_ the web. Not searching for something specific, not doom-scrolling through algorithmic feeds, but genuinely exploring. Following links from one person's homepage to another's, discovering communities built around the most niche interests you could imagine.

GeoCities was home to websites that were more than just digital business cards. URLs like `geocities.com/sunsetstrip/69420` led to a teenager's lovingly crafted shrine to their favourite obscure band, complete with tiled backgrounds, Comic Sans, and a gif of a stick man digging a hole to demonstrate that this website was under construction.

## The web of weirdos

The internet belonged to the enthusiasts. It didn't really mean anything to an average person, but it meant the world to people who would otherwise struggle to find a community and a sense of place.

These weren't content creators or influencers, they were just people who cared deeply about something and wanted to share it. The barrier to entry was knowledge, not follower count. You had to learn the basics of HTML and take the time to build and debug without the luxury of the tools we couldn't live without now. This natural filter meant that most people who bothered to make websites genuinely had something to say.

The aesthetic might have been questionable but the passion was real. Every site felt handmade, personal, and authentic. Unashamedly a reflection of the person who built it.

## When corporations had character

It wasn't just personal sites that had personality—even corporate websites were wonderfully weird. Visit the [Space Jam website from 1996](https://www.spacejam.com/1996/) and you'll find it preserved exactly as it was; bizarre navigation, stars for a background, and barely legible text (let's let the accessibility concerns slide for now).

Company executives didn't understand the early web. They knew they needed "a website" but had little idea what that meant. This benign neglect was a gift to the designers and developers who actually built these sites. Without layers of brand guidelines, focus groups, and conversion optimisation, they could experiment freely and build something that embraced this new technology.

The result was corporate websites with genuine personality. Apple's early site looked nothing like IBM's, which looked nothing like Nike's. Each company's web presence reflected not just their brand, but the individual creativity of whoever happened to be building it. A bank's website might have a playful Easter egg hidden in the source code. A car manufacturer might experiment with cutting-edge CSS animations just because they could.

Today, every company website looks fundamentally the same. The web has been committee'd and A/B tested into a bland, efficient sameness. We've ostensibly found the optimal way to convert visitors, and creativity has been sacrificed.

When everyone optimises for the same metrics, they inevitably converge on the same solutions. The web became a game of best practices, and best practices lead to averages.

## The always-on trap

The most fundamental shift was one that one that could only be seen as progress. We stopped going online and started being online all the time.

In the dial-up era, connecting to the internet was a deliberate act. You'd dial, endure the symphony of electronic screeching, and then you were online with a list of things to do. You had emails to check (from people!), sites to visit, downloads to start before bed. Being online was a finite activity. When you were done, you'd disconnect and return to the world.

This friction was good. It made time online was intentional; you went to the internet to _do_ something, not to kill time or fill empty moments. The barrier to entry created focus.

Now, the concept of "going offline" is so unusual it requires special modes, retreats, and digital detoxes. We've gone from choosing to connect to having to choose to disconnect. The internet is now a dimension of the real world.

This shift ushered in the attention economy. When you're always connected, there's always something new to check, always another notification to answer, always something to scroll. A notification gave you the dopamine hit, not the discovery of something new. The internet sticks its nose in constantly.

## Platforms

Social media promised to make publishing easier and connection simpler. The option to customise your MySpace page was still there and opened this customisation to a wider audience, while making it optional. Networking increased discoverability.

The cost of this move was trading control for convenience. Those weird, wonderful personal sites began to wither. Why would someone visit your homepage when they could just follow you on Twitter? The distributed web of individuals began to consolidate into a handful of massive silos.

Social media started as a way to stay connected with friends—and for a brief moment, it worked. You could see what your uni mates were up to, share photos with family, discover old friends in different cities. The promise was genuine human connection, scaled up and made more efficient.

## The great pivot

Platforms need to make money, and genuine human connection doesn't scale profitably. The pivot was subtle at first, with promoted posts here, suggested follows there The algorithm began to optimise for engagement rather than relevance, for time spent rather than satisfaction. No more linear feeds, no more chronological order, just an always changing stream of content to keep you scrolling.

What had been a tool for staying in touch with people you actually knew became a firehose of content from people you'd never met pushing their sponsored content, courses, brand affiliations, and ads disguised as not ads.

Social media stopped being social. It became a marketplace for attention where normal people tried to make themselves into brands to sell their highly curated lives and inadvertently made others miserable.

## The next pivot

Now we're facing another transition, potentially more dramatic than the last. Large language models and AI agents are becoming the primary interface between people and information online. Instead of browsing websites or scrolling feeds, we're increasingly asking AI to find, synthesise, and present information for us, even when we know that it's slower and often less accurate.

This could be the most significant change to how we consume digital information since the web browser itself. For most people, this will feel like an improvement. No more scrolling past sponsored content and some inane backstory before the recipe you actually wanted.

But this efficiency comes with a cost—the same cost we paid when we moved from personal websites to social platforms, only magnified. When AI becomes the primary interface to information, what happens to the sources of that information?

## The new extraction economy

The AI pivot has created a new kind of digital colonialism. Major publishers and platforms are now signing exclusive deals to feed their content directly into AI training datasets—Reddit to Google, News Corp to OpenAI, Stack Overflow to everybody. The data that was previously accessible to anyone with a web browser is being monetised and gate-kept behind AI partnerships.

Meanwhile, millions of smaller creators and websites have their content scraped without consent, attribution, or compensation. The AI systems happily reproduce their work, their research, their creativity—but the original sources get nothing. It's plagiarism at planetary scale, dressed up as technological progress.

And the environmental cost is staggering. Training ChatGPT-4 consumed more electricity than 1,000 US homes use in a year. Every query to these models burns through computational resources that would make crypto mining blush. We're literally heating the planet so people can ask AI to write emails they don't want to write to people who don't want to read them.

The internet went from connecting people to extracting from them. Now AI is extracting from the entire accumulated knowledge of humanity while contributing to its potential extinction. It's capitalism's final boss fight against the concept of shared knowledge.

## Full circle

If AI agents are scraping and summarising most content automatically, the incentive to create content purely for SEO or social media reach diminishes. Why optimise for human readers who aren't coming anyway?

This could mean that websites return to serving smaller, more focused audiences—people who actively seek them out rather than stumbling across them through platforms or search engines. The economics of content creation might shift back towards quality over quantity, depth over engagement.

The specialists and enthusiasts might find their footing again. When you're not competing for algorithmic distribution, there's less pressure to game the system. You can focus on the people who genuinely care about your subject matter, the ones who will bookmark your site and visit it directly.

This isn't necessarily a return to GeoCities—the tools are different, the context has changed, and we've learned things about accessibility and design that we can't unlearn. But it might be a return to the spirit of the early web: websites made by people who have something specific to say, for audiences who specifically want to hear it.

The question is whether we'll recognise this opportunity when it comes, or whether we'll find new ways to ruin it. Because if there's one thing we've proven over the past two decades, it's our remarkable ability to take something good and optimise it into mediocrity.

The internet isn't broken by accident. We broke it on purpose, one small compromise at a time, in service of growth and engagement and conversion rates. The next time we have the chance to build something better, maybe we should optimise for connection instead.
