Going online used to be be something you did. You'd connect to the internet, surf some websites, maybe some message boards, and maybe read some email that wasn't spam or a receipt for some crap you'd ordered. My earliest days of involved running a cable down the stairs, unplugging the phone, and using a free 0800 number to dial up in order to look at websites about mountain biking. These websites all had a delightful naivety to them, conveying the personality of that brand, and in the mid to late 90s, mountain bike brands had a lot of personaility.

A lot of what follows is likely shaded by nostalgia, but there is also a lot objective truth about how something that used to be fun has become stale, harmful, addictive, and inescapable.

## Personality

Geocities, myspace, Tumblr. Show your own taste and personality without the incentive of popularity

## Social media

Exploration is over
Connecting with people you know, keeping connections, 'friends reunited'
Influencers, product placement, over consumption and trends feeding FOMO
Algorithmic feeds, not seeing new or conflicting ideas, so when exposed to them, they're more extreme and scary
AI generation and misinformation rife; fairly obvious now but will be indistinguishable from reality soon

## You will own nothing

Digital Rights Management (DRM) is baked into most of the digital media you 'own', except you absolutely do not own it. When you buy a book for your Kindle all you have purchased is the right to access the book. Amazon can take that book away from you whenever they want, or allow you to continue to access a modified or censored version. You have zero recourse.

## The illusion of safety

The recently enacted [Online Safety Act](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer) will require visitors to certain content to verify that they're an adult.

There is a problem with the internet and children. While there is a constant stream of harm in the shape of influencers pushing consumerism, supplements, impossible standards of lifestyle and spending that these measures will not touch, access to adult content is how the act has been sold as a good thing. Won't you think of the children?

I can't decide if the introduction of this law is drenched in genuine ignorance or if the knock-on effects were foreseen and it was always intended to trojan-horse in more laws to limit freedoms and online anonymity. Neither would surprise me. In the wake of this bill, VPN use has soared and members of parliament have already proposed restrictions on their use, as if there aren't scenarios where using a VPN is essential for protecting yourself online and maintaining any kind of privacy.

For those that do choose to verify their age, where is that data going? You're expected to trust a third party with personally identifiable information that was submitted so you could watch porn? What could go wrong?

## We can access everything and it means nothing

All the art, poetry, and music ever produced is at our fingertips. All the science we have to help us understand the universe. The complete history of anything that we're curious about. All the resources to learn anything, and examples of the best to have ever done that thing.

And yet we're filling our eyes with things that don't even exist. Generated AI slop which is the product of plagiarism and pollution. 'Look its a picture of my dog in a Studio Ghibli style that I made by asking the computer for it'.

## Will AI agents fundamentally change in the internet?

The internet was, and still is, a series of interconnected documents. We have pushed what is possible to an almost unrecognisable extent, but beneath it all it's still just documents.

With LLMs continually crawling all they can, browsing websites for things like recipes and financial advice is already starting to look a little quaint. I don't know if this is actively happening yet, but it will become normal for people to feed information directly to LLMs in place of waiting for that information to be crawled.

Between information being distributed in this way and brands deriving most of their business from third party social media is there really a need and a future for the websites?

## Full circle

Websites will become pointless and fun and the domain of the few once again. They're not going to built or designed to provide quick information, they're not going to build a brand or gain a following. They can't compete with AI and social media. With that freedom there will be space to be weird again. Back to the website as a unique medium that's not for everyone.
