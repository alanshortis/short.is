Going online used to be be something you did. You'd connect to the internet and surf some websites, maybe some message boards, and maybe read some email that wasn't spam or a receipt for some crap you'd ordered. My earliest days of going online involved running a cable down the stairs, unplugging the phone, and using a free 0800 number to dial up in order to look at websites about mountain biking that were published in a print magazine.

That should suggest that a lot of what follows is based in nostalgia, but there is also a lot objective truth about how something that used to be fun has become ubiquitous and horrible.

## Personality

Geocities, myspace, Tumblr. Show your own taste and personality without the incentive of popularity

## Social media

Connecting with people you know, keeping connections, 'friends reunited'
Influencers, product placement, over consumption and trends feeding FOMO
AI generation and misinformation rife; fairly obvious now but will be indistinguishable from reality soon

## You will own nothing

Torrenting crimes
Kindle books will disappear
Content can be gone at any time
People going back to piracy; if you don't own it, how can it be theft?

## The illusion of safety

The recently enacted [Online Safety Act](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer)...

Looks like it should be a good thing on the surface, to people who don't really understand the internet
Will push people to less regulated and therefore more extreme platforms
[VPN use through the roof](https://www.wired.com/story/vpn-use-spike-age-verification-laws-uk/)
Spotify introducing it; will not prevent anything, will just push people back to piracy
