Going online used to be be something you did. You'd connect to the internet and surf some websites, maybe some message boards, and maybe read some email that wasn't spam or a receipt for some crap you'd ordered. My earliest days of going online involved running a cable down the stairs, unplugging the phone, and using a free 0800 number to dial up in order to look at websites about mountain biking that were published in a print magazine.

That should suggest that a lot of what follows is based in nostalgia, but there is also a lot objective truth about how something that used to be fun has become ubiquitous and horrible.

## Mainstream

Even after the internet became mainstream and was no longer a scary fad for dorks there was still a lot of space for fun
