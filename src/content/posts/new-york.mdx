As the [Milton Glaser designed logo](https://www.miltonglaser.com/the-work/81/new-york-state-i-love-ny-campaign/) states, I love New York. I don't care if this is a cliché or predictable. I have visited New York fourteen times in the last eighteen years, and every single time I have felt the city change me. I truly believe that anyone can be exactly who they want to be in New York, without exception. I first visited in 2007, staying with people I met on the Primus message board, and in person in 2006 at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in Tennessee. They lived in The Bronx, and being in the birthplace of hip hop was not lost on me.

The city was broke and dangerous in the late 70s and early 80s, but if time travel were a thing that is the time and place I would choose. Every time.

It breaks my heart a little that I will never be able to live in New York. With the benefit of hindsight, I know I should have moved on a student visa, to study _anything_, in my 20s when I still had the stomach for living in a cramped and shared apartment. It sounds so simple, but at that age I was broke and incapable of beliving that a move of that magnitude was possible for someone like me. My annual visits were only possible by saving all year for the cheapest flights and sleeping on friends' couches.

To move to the city now would require a work visa and a vast salary. I don't think I have the talent to land such a role and my right-to-remain being contingent on my employment is not something I feel comfortable with. I also don't feel comfortable with the fucking disgrace that is the current government and their efforts to erase history, dismantle trans rights, and <del>deport</del> <ins>exile</ins> people without trial.

Assuming the USA doesn't fall to fascism, I'm going to keep going back frequently. I'm going to keep ordering the same food and drinks from the same seat in the same restaurants, bars, and taverns. I'm still going to feel something every time I see the skyline. Another 18 years will pass and take me to my 60s and it'll still feel like home from home.
