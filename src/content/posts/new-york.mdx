I decided to write this while at Village Vanguard in Greenwich Village. The list of musicians who have performed there is astounding, and is a testament to what this city is and what it means.

As the Milton Glaser designed logo states, I love New York. I don't care if this is a cliché. I have visited New York fourteen times in the last eighteen years, and every single time I have felt the city change me. I truly believe that anyone can be exactly who they want to be in New York, without exception. I first visited in 2007, staying with people I met the previous summer at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in Tennessee. They lived in The Bronx, and being in the birthplace of hip hop was not lost on me. The city was broke and dangerous in the late 70s and early 80s, but if time travel were a thing that is the time and place I would choose. Every time.

It breaks my heart a little that I will never be able to live here. With the benefit of hindsight, I know I should have moved here on a student visa, to study _anything_, in my 20s when I still had the stomach for living in a cramped and shared apartment. To move now would require a work visa and a salary far beyond what is realistic. I don't think I have the talent to land such a role and my right-to-remain being contingent on my job is not something I feel comfortable with. And that's before we get to the fucking disgrace that is the current governement.

I'm going to keep coming back. I'm going to keep ordering the same food and drink from the same seat in the same restaurants and bars. I'm still going to feel something every time I see the skyline. Another 18 years will pass and take me to 60 years old and it'll still feel like home from home.
