As the [Milton Glaser designed logo](https://www.miltonglaser.com/the-work/81/new-york-state-i-love-ny-campaign/) states, I love New York. I don't care if this is a cliché or predictable; I have been visiting New York regularly for eighteen years and every single time I have felt the city change me. I truly believe that anyone can be exactly who they want to be in New York, without exception.

Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, Scorsese, and The Beastie Boys are all globally known and their work is inseparable from the city's energy, even when a piece has no literal connection. We can argue about what modern music is, but I can confidently argue that it came from New York.

I first visited in 2007, staying with people I met online. They lived in The Bronx, and being in the birthplace of hip hop was not lost on me. I understood why this city breeds innovation, even if it was in response to the horrific policies pushed by Robert Moses and his ilk.

It breaks my heart a little that I will never be able to live in New York. With the benefit of hindsight, I know I should have moved on a student visa, to study anything, in my 20s when I still had the stomach for living in a cramped and shared apartment. Going to Juilliard to study music is my idealised revisionist fantasy. It never felt possible to me at that time, being broke and lacking the ambition and guts to believe.

To move to the city now, as a 40-something, would require a work visa and a vast salary. I don't think I have the talent to land such a role, and my right-to-remain being contingent on my employment is not something I feel comfortable with. I don't think this is the same lack of belief as my 20s, it's a realistic understanding of my own limitations.

I'm going to keep visiting. I'm going to spend the last day of each visit feeling some loss around my impending departure. I'm going to keep ordering the same food and drinks from the same seat in the same restaurants, bars, taverns, and clubs. I'm still going to feel something every time I see the skyline. Another 18 years will pass and take me to my 60s and it'll still feel like home from home even as it continues to change, as it always has and always will. I'll still do mental gymnastics to calculate how I can spend my retirement in Village Vanguard.
