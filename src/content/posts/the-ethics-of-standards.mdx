Three times today alone, a choice by engineers to roll-their-own solution to a problem that has established standards made something simple MUCH harder than it should have been:

- Royal Mail making a form entirely JavaScript powered and not using standard form elements led to it being almost totally unresponsive with validation errors blocking submission but nothing in the UI to give any feedback at all
- Ticketmaster building a weird custom `select` element that didn't work with the keyboard, and every `option` within having a scroll event that prevented seeing more options with the wheel or trackpad. Though in the case of Ticketmaster, this is the least of their ethical missteps
- NowTV on Apple TV not using the standard search or login dialogs, making normal features like searching by voice or the keyboard on your phone unavailable. This leaves the virtual keyboard on screen as the only option, which is not only much harder to use but also encourages weaker passwords

Every one of these is more work for a worse experience for users AND the engineers who built them. Failure from conception to delivery, from product owners, designers, engineers, and testers. How have we managed to lose sight of the truth that the simplest solution is usually the best?

I once worked with someone who believed that anyone writing code for public consumption should have some kind of qualification. If writing code is a branch of engineering, then it should be treated the same way. Being self taught, I strongly disagreed at the time but I'm much more in favour of education in ethics (not engineering) being required for most roles. It's absurd that we should have to mandate consideration for the end user over anything else.

Many Canadian-trained engineers wear an [Iron Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Ring) as a reminder of their obligations and the ethics of their profession. Wearing a reminder and the ceremony that goes with it surely changes the way they think about how to solve the engineering problems they face while avoiding harm.

Obviously there are levels; a bridge failing offers much more direct risk to people than a website not working, but when websites manage healthcare, banking, benefits, and other essential services the blast area is vast and difficult to see unless you're going to be hit.

It doesn't end at specific, published standards. Accepted norms are just as important and become second nature to those who use them. If you think about it for a second, cars are an absolutely deranged concept. After passing an arbitrary assessment you're trusted to pilot tons of metal at high speed around other people who are just as qualified. Things like indicating, turning on lights and adjusting the temperature should require zero thought and no requirement to look away from the road. Despite this, the lower cost of producing software than hardware means these things are increasingly hidden in menus on a screen with no tactile feedback.

Switches and stalks on the steering column are simple, effective, natural, and expected. Leave it capitalism to to say 'yeah but what if we could save a few pennies and make it seem like luxury? What if our moronic CEO wants to produce a meme-on-wheels with hard edges that would rip through a human?'.
