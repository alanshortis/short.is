I tend to agree with opinion pieces that argue against AI more often than I agree with those that argue for. These pieces, no matter which argument they're trying to make, are rarely nuanced; I end up in this position of ambivalence because I see real benefits of some of the tools AI unlocks almost every day, all while failing to shake unease and objection to the real cost.

## AI bad

My biggest problem with AI is that it is an ethical nightmare. Extreme water and energy consumption, industrial scale plagiarism, and susceptibility to manipulation that can ultimately have an LLM confidently tell you whatever you want to hear. It'll coach someone into suicide because it has no concept or right or wrong, it's just probability and a programmed desire to please the user.

Product owners scrambling to attach AI and that fucking sparkle icon in any way they can, even when the statistics clearly indicate that there is no benefit. No one wants to talk to an AI chatbot so they can waste time before waiting to talk to a human who can actually help.

The stock market is propped up by companies who either produce hardware that makes all of this possible or by companies who start to lose more money the moment they install that hardware. Eventually this will cause a crash that makes 2008 look pathetic.

Saving the best to last; AI powered [humanoid robots](https://www.figure.ai/) that are being sold as friendly personal assistants will be much less friendly when busting protesters' heads open.

## AI good

Maybe I should have written this section first, because after that tour through the dystopia we find ourselves in, the practical benefits that actually help me from day to day feel barely worthwhile.

I write code for a corporation for a living. There is a level of creativity in that, but it's mostly delivering someone else's vision in a manner that is reliable and well tested. AI tools like Claude and Cursor have made me more productive and more informed. Code generation doesn't begin and end with vibe coding and a pile of dreadful code. Collaborate with it, question it, give it well defined and clear tasks and outcomes. Tell it to review outcomes and learn from how it got there. Ask it to write prompts for itself in a format that it prefers. Talking to an LLM should not be treated like talking to a human; you have to lead it to the results.

Being dyslexic and enjoying writing is a strange mixture. I never get an LLM to write for me based on a prompt; this and everything else was written by hand by me. However, AI can be an excellent proof reader. When I have finished writing, I'll use this prompt:

> Read this text carefully and look for spelling errors, repetition, variation in tense, poor word choice, and any other issues that may reduce the quality and readability. Do not make any edits directly; summarise your findings and I will work through them and make the changes myself.

The point and purpose of each of these uses of AI is not only to get me to a better outcome, but also to get my future self to a better outcome before turning to AI tools. I am managing to stay on the right side of this balance, but that temptation to just outsource is always there and is growing.

## Temptation

Even with my relatively low level of AI use I catch myself considering it for things that I really do not want to use it for. Photography is something I like to do as an escape from needing to produce for my livelihood. My equipment is chosen deliberately to slow things down, but this also means that I miss quite a few shots. Focus, framing, depth of field. When trying to get the shot, it's really easy to get at least one of them wrong.

Lightroom has AI image generation built in and can do a good job of fixing these flaws in a pretty convincing way. Yeah, I can save a photo that I wish I'd nailed, but is it still the same if that save was made by AI?

## tl;dr

'[Give me convenience or give me death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mMW3UA7g_0)' may not be a choice anymore. We're going to get both much more quickly than we'd like.
