import { Concerns, ExampleEmbed } from '../../components';

I have [complained before](/writing/standards-and-ethics/) about the tendency for product teams to build custom user interfaces that are worse than the native equivalent in every possible way. The [web share API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Share_API) and [custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomElementRegistry/define) are platform features that can be combined to build a share component with the best possible UX, minimal code, and progressive enhancement.

## The web share API

The web share API allows access to the operating system's native share dialog. It contains recent contacts, apps that can share, AirDrop, etc. It's used like this:

```JS
const share = async () => {
  try {
    await navigator.share({
      title: 'Hold on to your butts',
      url: 'https://butt.holdings',
    });
  } catch (e) {
    if (e.name === 'AbortError') {
      console.log('Share cancelled');
    } else {
      console.error(e);
    }
  }
}
```

`share` is on the `navigator` object and takes an object with `title` and `url` properties. You can also provide `text` to and an array of `files`. Each of these are optional and `title` may be ignored if the sharing method has no way to use it, e.g. an email has a title field, but text messages probably don't.

It's necessary to use `try` `catch` as a thrown error is not necessarily a genuine error. A cancelled share (i.e. the user opened the share menu but closed it without sharing) will throw, but this is useful if you want to gather statistics on sharing behaviour. In the example above we check for `AbortError` to handle this case.

## Custom elements

> I'll use React for comparisons, but the same principles apply to any framework.

Custom elements are part of the web components spec and allow us to make self contained elements that work alongside standard HTML. Like React components, they can contain all their markup, styling, and logic.

What's the benefit when React already does this?

- React is heavy, and if you have a mostly static website that needs a small amount of interactivity, custom elements are a lighter alternative
- If some feature of JavaScript, or custom elements themselves, are not supported, custom elements can be conditionally defined and ignored if necessary
- If your business uses a variety of web technologies, custom elements are agnostic and can be used anywhere making them a great option for design systems and component libraries. Put them in a React app, a static site, PHP, Classic ASP. Ship them in your CDN and use them in your CMS. Whatever you like

### Separation of concerns

Before React and composing sites and apps from components, concerns were separated by technology:

<Concerns />

HTML should be separate from CSS should be separate from JavaScript. This makes sense while still considering web pages as being structured documents with ancillary functionality and styling. When composing apps from components, separation of concerns has shifted. The functionality and styling are no longer supporting a primary document, but are instead contributing core functionality. Concerns are now the all the parts of each technology that make a component work; structure (HTML), styling (CSS) and behaviour (JavaScript):

<Concerns asComponent />

### The simplest possible custom element

The simplest possible custom element looks like this:

```JS
class MyElement extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.innerHTML = 'This is a <em>custom element</em>.'
  }
}

customElements.define('my-element', MyElement);
```

The `define` method on `customElements` requires two arguments. First, a string that represents the name of the custom element, which must [meet a few criteria](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomElementRegistry/define#valid_custom_element_names). Then, a class that defines the custom element. There is nothing particularly special about this class, except the `connectedCallback` method which is called once the custom element has been attached to the DOM.

This new custom element can be used just like any HTML element:

```html
<my-element></my-element>
```

<ExampleEmbed title="Custom element example" url="/examples/custom-element" />

You can open this example in a new tab to see the custom element rendered in the dev tools.

## Web share API custom element

```JS
class ShareButton extends HTMLElement {
    constructor() {
      super();

      this.shareUrl = window.location.href;
      this.shareTitle = document.title;
    }

    connectedCallback() {
      this.innerHTML = `
      <style>
        .share {
          background-color: #eb5c0f;
          border-radius: 1.9em;
          color: white;
          cursor: pointer;
          display: block;
          font-size: .9em;
          font-weight: bold;
          padding: .5em 1em;
        }
      </style>

      <button class="share" type="button">Share</button>
    `;

      this.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', async () => {
        try {
          await navigator.share({
            title: this.shareTitle,
            url: this.shareUrl,
          });
        } catch (e) {
          console.error(e);
        }
      });
    }
  }

  customElements.define('share-button', ShareButton);
```

Let's break down everything that's been added:

- Add a constructor and define a couple of variables for sharing, getting the current URL and the page title
- Add the markup for the button, and style it with CSS
- Add an event listener to the button that opens the share menu

> Styles can be scoped to a custom element via [shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM), another part of the web components spec, which is not covered here. Styles added in a custom element as they are here are global

Here is our working share button component:

<ExampleEmbed title="Share button example" url="/examples/share-button" />

If you can't see the share button, it's probably because your browser doesn't support the API. You may need to come back in a [browser that is supported](https://caniuse.com/web-share).

### Testing for support

Before rendering you can check for support for both custom elements and features used and conditionally define the element:

```JS
if ('customElements' in window && 'share' in navigator) {
  customElements.define('share-button', ShareButton);
}
```

Browsers ignore HTML tags they don't recognise, so if the custom element hasn't been defined nothing happens. No errors, no non-functional buttons, it just doesn't render and no one is any the wiser.

## Wrapping up

This example barely scratches the surface of what custom elements and the wider web components spec can provide. Some of the approaches here don't scale as well as any large app would require, but the web share API's particular requirements for browser support and implementation make this a good-enough tiny component. There is room for improvement, but we're really getting into diminishing returns.

While it's hard to see how React will ever fall out of favour, web components have been adopted by Adobe, Sales Force, YouTube, and many others in high traffic production apps. React makes it really easy to get going quickly, but that convenience quickly catches up with you and limits you to a specific set of tools, features, and dependency headaches.

If I were lucky enough to be at the beginning of a project to build a design system for a large team of web engineers, I would give web components some serious consideration at the very least. There will be scenarios where React is not the best option.

## Future

All of this could become unnecessary at some time on the future, and that's a good thing. [Open UI are looking at invoker commands](https://open-ui.org/components/future-invokers.explainer/) which would make additional features declarative via a new `command` attribute. It could look something like this:

```html
<button command="share" value="https://butt.holdings">Share</button>
```

It's not yet clear how every share value (url, title, text, files) would be represented.
