Early on in my love of building websites, I used Dreamweaver. I used Dreamweaver because all I knew was writing HTML and CSS by hand in Notepad. Suddenly I could have syntax highlighting, indentation, and a built in FTP client. It was the <del>future</del> <ins>present</ins>.

Dreamweaver also had a visual editor. It was dreadful. This was before semantic HTML and responsive design so the fact that it would spit out a sea of `div`s and absolutely position them was about as good as we could expect. The bar was low.

Many years later, with mature methods for building layouts that are more than just a series of boxes and computing power far beyond people's imagination just a few years ago, [Figma](https://www.figma.com/sites/) have managed to produce a tool whose generated HTML is barely better than Dreamweaver's efforts. There are huge gains in styling and responsiveness, but the very basics of accessibility and semantics are totally absent.

Some strange things about the code that Figma generates:

- The last character for every string of text is wrapped in a `span` for some reason
- Headings do not use `h*` tags at all, and instead us `div` with an `aria-label` of the same value. Screen readers will announce this twice
- Inline links are `a` elements, so that good
- Links that appear like buttons, or block elements that are links are `div` with a role of `link`, a `tab-index` of `0` to allow it to be focussed, and an `href` attribute that is then actioned using JavaScript
- Hover states are handled with JavaScript, not CSS
- Headings are just `div` elements

Some of these choices are so, so weird to me:

- Using `role` suggests that maybe they were thinking about accessibility in some sense, but if the tool is able to add these where it feels they're needed why not just use the correct HTML element?
- Why action a link with JavaScript at all? Again, just use the correct element and the JS is instantly redundant
- When putting together a design in Figma, you can make headings. Apparently these only carry the style and not the semantics. I can see where the separation is happening since appearance and semantics should remain exclusive, but there is at least something in the existing UI to make the distinction that they decided not to use

While websites can look just like flat printed media that you can click on, what's happening beneath is complicated and nuanced. You cannot assume how your users will interact with your site, and making a site as accessible as possible is the bare minimum. This is not optional without blatant discrimination. All of the choices (and they are choices) above break the most basic principles.

I have been in a position of trying to convince a manager that time (and, therefore, money) invested in accessibility will come back to them in the form of a better product, only to be told that it's too expensive or that a deadline is too tight and we can let it slide. While engineers don't always manage to win that argument, at least the argument is being made and the basics are being adhered to during a build. If the people who care about the craft aren't even in the room, it's never a conversation. Smaller businesses and agencies whose profit comes from margin and shipping as quickly as possible this looks like a godsend.

To quote Steve Jobs:

> When you’re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you’re not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You’ll know it’s there, so you’re going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back. For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.

This doesn't fit the point perfectly but it's a reminder that the detail and the craft matter. The aesthetics might be what people see initially, but if it's built on landfill it's going to smell and eventually sink.

Steve also believed in the open web and the power of shared standards, as articulated in his [justification of leaving Flash behind](https://web.archive.org/web/20170615060422/https://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/). While Figma isn't producing sites using technology that is closed or proprietary, it is not correctly adhering to the standards of the open technologies it does use.

I'm sure it was rushed out to coincide with their conference and I'm sure there were people at Figma trying to make the case for it not being ready. I'm also sure this will improve quickly, and like AI assistants will be used as a tool that can make a human faster and more efficient rather than a straight up replacement. While releasing a product before it's perfect and then iterating is usually a good thing, this isn't an acceptable minimum viable product. I am concerned this this could be a major backslide for the open and accessible web unless they can respond quickly and make this tool not a total disaster.
