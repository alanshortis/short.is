Early on in my love of building websites, I used Dreamweaver. I used Dreamweaver because all I knew was writing HTML and CSS by hand in Notepad. Suddenly I was able to acquire software that could highlight syntax, indent my code, and had a built in FTP client. It was the <del>future</del> <ins>present</ins>.

Dreamweaver had a visual editor. It was dreadful. This was before semantic HTML, flexbox, and responsive design so the fact that it would spit out a sea of `div`s and absolutely position them was about as good as we could expect. The bar was low.

Many years later, with mature methods for building layouts that are more than just a series of boxes, and computing power far beyond people's imagination just a few years ago, [Figma](https://www.figma.com/sites/) have managed to produce a tool whose generated code is barely better than Dreamweaver's efforts. The many issues have been widely reported, but among them is that something as obvious as a button being a `button` element is not within its capability.

While websites can look just like flat printed media that you can click on, what's happening beneath is complicated and nuanced. You cannot assume how your users will interact with your site, and making a site accessible to all is as basic and necessary as wheelchair access to a building. Using proper structure and semantic elements in order to give a site structure and meaning is as basic and necessary as subtitles for a TV show. This is not optional without blatant discrimination.

To smaller businesses and agencies whose profit comes from margin and shipping as quickly as possible this looks like a godsend. For most, convenience and speed will trump craft and ethics every time.

I have been in a position of trying to convince a manager that time (and, therefore, money) invested in accessibility will come back to them in the form of a better product, only to be told that it's too expensive or that a deadline is too tight and we can let it slide. While engineers don't always manage to win that argument, at least the argument is being made. If the people who care about the craft aren't even in the room, it's never a conversation.

People who call themselves tech leaders love Steve Jobs, and maybe see his thinking and beliefs in themselves. Here's a relevant quote:

> When you’re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you’re not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You’ll know it’s there, so you’re going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back. For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.

This doesn't fit the point perfectly but it's a reminder that the detail and the craft matter. The aesthetics might be what people see initially, but if it's built on landfill it's going to smell and eventually sink.

Steve also [believed in the open web](https://web.archive.org/web/20170615060422/https://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/) and the power of shared standards. While Figma isn't producing sites using technology that is closed or proprietary, it is not correctly adhering to the standards of the open technologies it does use.

I'm sure it was rushed out to coincide with their conference and I'm sure there were people at Figma trying to make the case for it not being ready. I'm also sure this will improve quickly, and like AI assistants will be used as a tool that can make a human faster and more efficient rather than a straight up replacement. While releasing a product before it's perfect and then iterating is usually good thing, this isn't an acceptable minimum viable product for anyone who understand what the web is and how it works. I am concerned this this could be a major backslide for the open and accessible web.
