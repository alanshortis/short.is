Feeling comfortable and settled? Use these tricks to boost your imposter syndrome:

- **Up the context switching:** Try to juggle multiple tasks, especially of different types
- **Don't take the time to learn:** You should just know these things already
- **Compare yourself to others:** The person who's been working at your company for 4 years longer than you knows more, and this is unacceptable
- **Convince yourself a question is stupid:** If something doesn't make sense but it feels like it should, berate yourself and try in vain to figure it out alone. That's what people who know what they're doing do
- **Wallow:** Bad day? Banging your head against a problem for hours only for the solution to be kind of obvious in hindsight? Unacceptable
