title: 'On cynicism'
---

I'm trying to push past my cynicism with the aim of feeling a bit better about myself. I have read a few books on Stoicism and I always have a boost in both my mood and my ability to manage how I feel about things, but it doesn't last.

Today I installed an app that shows stoic affirmations on my phone, right beside a widget reminding me of the next step of meditation in another app I would have previously struggled to give a fair chance.

I think what makes me cynical about this sort of thing is a feeling that I so far down a hole that I can't see a way out, so everything feels futile. But to borrow half a quote from AA: 'it works if you work it'.
