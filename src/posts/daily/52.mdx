The brief period between getting developed film back from the lab and starting the scanning process is just time to think about how exactly I managed to mess up every exposure.

After a visit to New York in May, it turned out my light meter was faulty and every shot was under exposed. Because I was coming out of a few years of ignoring my camera and not shooting I didn't realise that my readings were way off. I couldn't remember what felt what was normal.

Last week, again in New York, was different. I doubled checked my light readings, got a feel for what was right for the conditions, and chose my subjects carefully.

That hope that makes the wait to scan even worse. I'm not worried about about how I messed up, but in my head, I have 80 photos that [Stephen Shore](http://stephenshore.net/) would be proud of. The reality is probably neither; I'll have some pretty ok photos.
