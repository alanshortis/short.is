Despite the obvious violence, Red Dead Redemption II is one of the most relaxing forms of escapism I've ever found. There are plenty of opportunities to shoot bad guys, steal, and fight, but I tend to spend most of my time roaming around the absolutely vast open world finding beautiful waterfalls, landmarks (that the character, Arthur, will sketch), herbs and random people who'll buy them. If want more action, I can ride into the city of Saint Denis which I think is a version of New Orleans.

I'd pay money for a Zen version of this game; the map is open and there are no missions that progress the game. Just freedom to explore and peaceful side quests involving botany and collectables.
