title: 'On McDonalds'

While waiting in the Apple Store, the member of staff helping me asked what I do. She said she wants to get into coding but 'I work in retail now and I worked in McDonalds until last month, so I don't stand much of a chance'.

Never before have I enjoyed telling someone I worked for McDonalds and worked my way up to what I do now so much.

It's one of the few well paid careers that doesn't require any qualifications, and everything you need to know to land a job can be googled (leading to a job where you spend A LOT of time in Google).

It's Google all the way down.
