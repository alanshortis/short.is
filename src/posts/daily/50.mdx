I can't even imagine what it must feel like to own a home. Monthly payments that go into an appreciating asset and not just \*flying money emoji\*, and an asset that gives you access to better financial products to continue to see growth.

I've reached a point where the hardship required to save enough to buy something, while managing the expense of living alone, would make life so much more grey and uneventful that I'm not convinced I want it. I have only recently started to earn enough where saving is possible, but the deposit requirements are still insurmountable.

This isn't just grim pessimism either. I have been working on a 5 year plan this week, something I have never done before, and even the most optimistic outcomes would have me mortgage ready at an age that would push the monthly repayments a long way north of my current and historical rent, even adjusted for inflation.
