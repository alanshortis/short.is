Proper, focussed cycling training starts tomorrow. I have lost count of the amount of times I've told myself that, but maybe this time it's actually different.

I have everything I need. Bike, set up on a trainer, TrainerRoad subscription, a clear idea of the type of training that will work for me when combined with a proper diet and some mobility work, and a goal to ride the Italian alps next summer.

Execution is my problem. So much so that I even see targeted ads for overcoming procrastination.
