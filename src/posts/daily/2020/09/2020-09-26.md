Miles Davis - [Quiet Nights](https://www.discogs.com/Miles-Davis-Quiet-Nights/release/6723542) is not an album I would reach for very often. The last collaborative album with Gil Evans, it has an almost bossa nova feel in places which really makes me think of incidental music in early Bond films. This is a 180g pressing and sounds really rich for the most part, but unfortunately mine has a floor which means there is a very noticeable skip on the first side. The cover is a beautiful abstract image that looks like a painting but is credited as a photograph, so who knows.

[In a Silent Way](https://www.discogs.com/Miles-Davis-In-A-Silent-Way/release/7682704) is one of my favourite Jazz albums. Released in 1969, it almost sounds as if it could have accompanied the moon landings with its long thematic compositions; 'Shhh/Peaceful' in particular. With drums and bass being about as paired back as possible for the full 18 minutes, the remaining musicians really just add flourishes under Miles' own explorations. This is often regarded as the first fusion album and its influence certainly spread far and wide. It's pretty clear that [Talk Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzfwVYgBVFQ) were fans and it clearly influenced their later albums which have become vastly influential classics.

Somehow this is all the Miles Davis I have. Not even a copy of Kind of Blue which I'm sure breaks some kind of rule.

(I listened to In a Silent Way twice through while writing this, and in that time midnight came and went, so technically this post is a day late.)
