With the last few days dailies being written on my phone, I need to work on a smoother process for doing this mobile. I've taken the time to automate the creation and publication when working on my Mac but it's far from frictionless on mobile. It's made a little worse by it being the first of the month meaning sub folders needed to be created which is something I never need to do manually usually.

The GitHub app doesn't quite do everything I need so I ended up writing each day but saving the publication for when I'm home. Not a really big issue right now as these are still not actually public, but when they are I can't miss days.

It may just be down to process: having a template ready to go in Notion and just committing directly to the main branch wouldn't be terrible, but if I ever have time I could look at something bespoke using the GitHub API.
