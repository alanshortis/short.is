My first thought when putting on [We Care A Lot](https://www.discogs.com/Faith-No-More-We-Care-A-Lot/release/2741099) is: How has Mike Bourdin managed to keep his snare sound exactly the same on every Faith No More album? This is a weird album in many ways; Mike Patton wasn't yet a member of the band, and that more familiar sound wasn't quite established. 'The Jungle' sounds like it could have come from any number of new wave bands in the mid-80s, but the title track is _very_ FNM. It's not that I dislike this album, it's just that any time it's on I wonder why I'm not listening to Living Colour instead. This time is no exception. I haven't yet decided if I'll listen to side B.

The beginning and end of my Krautrock selection, [The Faust Tapes](https://www.discogs.com/Faust-The-Faust-Tapes/release/223803) is at the far more experimental end of the genre. Much like the Faith No More album above, this really makes me want to listen to something else: Can are my Krautrock band of choice. You cannot beat their groove.

I didn't buy either of these albums. In fact, I think I may have borrowed them from someone and just never gave them back. I'm so sorry to whoever that might have been. I'll gladly hand them back over. Please, take them.
