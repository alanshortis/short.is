Technical job interviews are pretty far from my forte. Today I was told would be a short, first stage chat to find out a bit more about me and how my career has looked so far but it turned into a few technical questions.

Starting with HTML and CSS, I was able to answer quickly, calmly, and confidently. Then as we moved on to JavaScript, the questions revolved around how code can be asynchronous. I struggled to think of an example of a callback despite being something I use daily, I struggled to describe each state of a promise, and fortunately the questions around async/await seemed a little easier as it was clearer in my head from recent work.

Being able to talk confidently about the whole stack is something I really need to work on. I may use this stuff daily but terminology and describing my thought process is really hard. Again, it's familiarity. I nailed the HTML and CSS questions because I have been working with those languages (yes, they _are_ languages) for a long time. JavaScript has been big and scary for a long time and while I can write what I need when I need it, I'm not that comfortable.
