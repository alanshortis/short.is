I can almost understand why people buy plastic plants. Not enough to actually have them, buying more landfill and having something totally unnatural in the house masquerading as nature, but still.

I have an infestation of spider mites that's already taken out three plants, and a home made solution of dish soap and water is hopefully what's going to save the rest.

Owning living things is very time consuming. Don't let me have a dog or a child, ok?
