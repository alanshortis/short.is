It's strange how events can skew your perception of time. When I was in school, I could almost visualise the 6 weeks break over summer as a huge, long period of time in the middle of the year. The time between September and December, and January to mid-July was compressed.

Now that I am half way through a two week break from work and am back home from a few days away I feel like winter is just days away.
