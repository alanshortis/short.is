Staring down a second lockdown thanks to the huge increase in cases and deaths is not a good feeling. It doesn't feel like the first happened very long ago, with the work days blending into one and despite the best intentions, weekends being lost of laziness and trying to hide.

I need to do it better this time, and try and make the best of forced isolation. Health and fitness needs to be at the forefront as I'm still not taking care of myself. My dissatisfaction with work could be remedied, if not solved.

Most importantly, try and avoid social media and people's opinions. The same people who were clapping for the NHS are now openly resisting measures that will save lives.
