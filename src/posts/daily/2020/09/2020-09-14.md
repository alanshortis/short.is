Another flight, and not to sound like a broken record but the view was once again incredible end-to-end. I don't really understand people who just read or look dead ahead when there is such immense beauty to see.

All the way up the Adriatic, looking down on Croatia and Albania, trying to figure out where we might be. Split looks like a city I'd like to visit even judged from 20,000'. Then, the Swiss alps, a little bit of Germany, and Luxembourg - where I actually recognised the reservoir near Vianden - then wind farms in the North Sea before the coast of East Anglia and down to Stanstead.

I have no idea how many flights it would take to grow tired of it, but I'd like to be able to fly enough to test it.
