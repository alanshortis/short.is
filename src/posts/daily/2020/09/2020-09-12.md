The Panathenaic Stadium in Athens is one of the most remarkable places I've ever been. There's been a stadium of some kind there for more than 2,300 years. The current incarnation is built entirely in white marble and is still used for events today, and was used as a venue for the Athens Olympics in 2004. I love that it's open and available to the public even with it being such an important historical site.

It's spotlessly clean, and clearly well respected by visitors. Unlike Stone Henge: It used to be possible to walk right up to the stones which led to some people scratching their names into the pillars themselves.
