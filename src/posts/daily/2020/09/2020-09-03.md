Before this week the only road I'd cycled that's closed to cars is Great Dun Fell. At the time it was by far the largest climb I'd ever done and I was hooked. After Stwlan Dam yesterday, today I did my third closed road climb all the way up to Marchlyn Mawr. The [Electric Mountain](https://veloviewer.com/segment/15049111) segment isn't quite how I did it. While I did the entirety of the segment, I took the right turn shortly after the gate to get up to a surge pool which sits a little higher than the famous dam.

After this (and a site down at the top to take in the view all the way to the Irish sea) was the [Llanberis Pass](https://veloviewer.com/segment/1600277) which like my last climb yesterday, finishes at Pen-y-pass. I loved this climb. Straight up at an average of 5% for 3.1 miles, so it's not big or long or hard (it's as hard as you want to make it), but it's consistent and incredibly scenic.
