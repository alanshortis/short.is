You shouldn't judge a book by its cover, and that probably applies to records too, but of each of the Bill Evans albums available in Rough Trade Nottingham, this is the one that jumped out at me. It looks as if it should be a mid-2000s post rock album, but couldn't be further from that. [Undercurrent](https://www.discogs.com/Bill-Evans-Jim-Hall-Undercurrent/release/6739387) is a collaboration with Jim Hall and is beautiful delicate late-night music. This pressing sounds absolutely terrible, so perhaps I should have looked beyond the cover after all.

Edan - [Beauty and the Beat](https://www.discogs.com/Edan-Beauty-And-The-Beat/release/442341) is in my holy trinity of underground hip-hop albums, along with Madvillainy and The Cold Vein. It's perfect from end to end, even though those ends are a little closer together than I'd like. I would really love Edan to make another album like this; in the 15 years that have passed there have been mix albums and a collaboration with Homeboy Sandman and as good as they are, it's not _this_.
