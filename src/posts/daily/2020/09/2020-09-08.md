I have definitely been vocal about smokers. failing to understand why they don't just quit. How hard can it be? It's disgusting and expensive so why don't they just stop?

I didn't really understand addiction then. The negative aspects of smoking don't outweigh the addiction no matter how much logical and rational thought goes into it. I have a fairly bad relationship with food, and it's the same thing. Sometimes I _need_ something filled with sugar and I will genuinely feel better after. It's just a different vice.
