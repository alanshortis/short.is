The death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg is set to make 2020 even more of a political mess than before. Republicans scrambling to get someone nominated before the November election not only contradicts their views when Scalia died and Obama was unable to name a replacement, but also means the make up of the court could be _very_ conservative.

In much the same way that people on the far-left will refuse to vote for Biden because he's not a perfect solution, people have also been pulling up examples of less-than perfect judgements made by RBG over her career and dismissing her as a result.

Extreme views either to the left or the right help no one. As she said herself, big changes happen in small steps and while Biden might be a smaller step to the left than a lot of people would like, it _is_ a step that must be taken.
