Deftones - [White Pony](https://www.discogs.com/Deftones-White-Pony/release/3651765), as I said just a couple of days ago, is another all-time favourite album of mine. It's really hard to believe that it's now 20 years old. I remember very clearly buying the limited edition red jewel case version from HMV in Southend. Admittedly I was just finding my feet with heavier music at that time so it was the first album of theirs I heard, at a time when I was still playing drums to a pretty high standard and that's how I judged most music. Abe Cunningham's playing got me hooked. This reissued LP came from Rough Trade in New York.

Dr. Who Dat? - [Beat Journey](https://www.discogs.com/Dr-Who-Dat-Beat-Journey/release/764523) is a bit of a hidden gem. It doesn't have that _something_ that Donuts has but it's still a flawlessly constructed set on instrumentals. I'd love to hear some emcees, but they stand up really well without. I bought it because it was released on Lex records in 2006 and around that time the list of releases on that label was immense. Most likely from HMV Oxford Street or Greenwich, where I was working at the time.

I am reading [Mountains: Epic Cycling Climbs](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29082578-mountains) while listening to Earth - [A Bureaucratic Desire For Extra-Capsular Extraction](https://www.discogs.com/Earth-A-Bureaucratic-Desire-For-Extra-Capsular-Extraction/release/2518454), and it's quite a fitting soundtrack. The photos in the book depict huge, unforgiving and intimidating mountains and the sparse-yet-heavy opening tracks of this album sound like they look. I certainly like the more recent Earth albums more than this, not least because of the use of a drum machine (though it's so sparese you barely notice the synthetic sounds below the drone). Still, a really good album for getting stuff done, and it's hard to believe it was recorded 30 years ago. I bought this in Rough Trade West in London.

[Angels Of Darkness, Demons Of Light I](https://www.discogs.com/Earth-Angels-Of-Darkness-Demons-Of-Light-I/release/2836015) is my favourite Earth album, and is presented in a beautiful gatefold sleeve. It's a double album but with three sides of music so the empty side is etched with the cover art (in a sense) making this a pretty unique thing to own. It sounds incredible - the lows are _low_ and the addition of cello makes it all sound very wide. Also, no drum machine! It's incredible how much difference it makes when something is played with expression by a human. I got this at the same time as my other Earth album and is one of my most played; it sounds so much better than any digital version, even more so through my recently acquired Audiolab 8000A.
