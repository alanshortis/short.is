I read an entire book today, in one sitting. Before you get too impressed, it was a book that accompanies my favourite TV series, Six Feet Under. I added a review to Goodreads, which I'm going to repeat here for today's entry:

If you like the TV show, this book is a perfect companion.

I’ve seen every episode many times - it’s my favourite show of all time - and as such I think of the characters as people I know, love, hate and miss. The book elaborates on themes and back stories mentioned in the series, and conversely the books alludes to parts of the story line without ever being on the nose or far fetched.

I always thought the characters were perfectly consistent across all 5 seasons. Nothing was added that seemed wrong for anyone; it all made sense to who they are and became. This is true of the book too, even when reading things David and Nate wrote as kids, it’s SO right.
