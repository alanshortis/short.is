My few days in Snowdonia are over, but today I rode from Betws-y-coed to Crewe. One major climb today, the stupidly named [World's End](https://veloviewer.com/segment/4260712). Repeating the early parts of Horseshoe Pass to get to the start you don't exactly arrive fresh, and the average gradient of 3.5% is vastly misleading as there are a few short ramps _down_ at around 15% before ramping up.

Like all the climbs I did this week, I like that I have been able to complete and experience them, but I would like to return to them all at some point. A combination of a massive dip in fitness, gain in weight, and two days with several kilos of luggage on the bike made for times and a required effort that I am not proud of. I've never been fast, but things are pretty dire at the moment.
