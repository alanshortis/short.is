I've been bitten by the gravel cycling bug. Mountain biking was my thing some years back, but that gave way to road. I appear to be going full circle. With COVID restrictions making close-quarters road riding much more difficult, groups have been going out for gravel, tow paths, and woodland trails and it looks extremely fun.

The build will be very low budget. A generic aluminium frame branded by the company selling it, whatever groupset parts and wheels I locate, and whatever parts I already have that will work. It'll take a while to get together, but the possibilities are making me excited for cycling all over again.
