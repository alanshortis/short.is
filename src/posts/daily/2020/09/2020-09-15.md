Back to work after 17 days off, and straight into some TypeScript learning.

TS has plenty of claimed benefits but I am stuck in the 'WHY' phase of learning. Right now, it just feels like it's in the way and preventing me from actually building the thing I'm paid to build.

This isn't the first time I have felt this way, however. It's all about familiarity, in the same way that Greek is just nonsense to me (I know what Sigma and Omega are but what do they mean _in that context_) but given time and effort it would all make sense. It's no different for TypeScript. At least, I hope so.
