When sport and exercise gets serious it's very easy for it to become all to quantified. Data must be gathered and stored away, 'if it's not on Strava it didn't happen', power and heart rate are correlated to see if if fitness is improving (or was it just a bad day? Maybe a bit warm? Did I eat enough?) or declining.

Today I rode around 38 miles to meet my Dad at a cafe quite close to his house. I'd not seen him since COVID started so it was good to catch up. Following from a 70 mile ride the day before, I'd forgotten to charge my Wahoo (it's like a Garmin) which would have logged the time, speed, distance, elevation, power and heart rate to be squirrelled away with the rest of my rides since 2014. But it died after about 15 minutes of riding, and I honestly enjoyed not having all the numbers in my face for the ride. 'Riding on feel' is another tired phrase like the one above, but at times it can be genuinely freeing to just ride a bike and not turn it into a statistical exercise.
