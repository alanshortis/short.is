The Aegean is warm and crystal clear. I don't usually like swimming in the sea, but I could get used to that.

Like a lot of coastal places, gaining access to the real beauty spots is pretty difficult as a pedestrian. People are driven to their private beeches and resorts and rarely arrive on the Metro. But, once we'd made it then and paid â‚¬20 to access the beech, it was worth the effort. Until today, I never really got the appeal of the beech; maybe months in the same two rooms was all it took to convert me.
