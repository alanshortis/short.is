Huge procrastination issues today. Everything and nothing was holding my attention better than the work I need to be completing, and it's really becoming a problem.

We're just starting to launch a huge new initiative at work, and while I have contributed to it in some ways the bulk of my work during this time has been parallel. Involved but not committed. [Chicken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicken_and_the_Pig).

I've written about this before, and I expect I will again. Retaining interest in something that I ultimately don't find very interesting is not a new problem for me. It's why I didn't do well in school. It's why I've forgotten more than I've learned over the last 2 years.
