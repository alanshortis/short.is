Even with the added complication of COVID measures, I still love flying. On the way to Athens, the views from the window were spectacular for about 90% of the journey. Vast cloud structures in a sea of blue light, the tail end of the alps with light bisecting the valleys, and the sunset over the Mediterranean (or the Aegean; I'm not entirely sure where one becomes the other) looking like distant fires.

I didn't even really think about the fact I was flying on 9/11. Nineteen years on, I sometimes think about that day. My Dad had visited the World Trade Centre on September 10th and was still in Manhattan when the towers fell. I was at work in McDonalds, watching it all unfold on TV and failing to get through to him on the phone. I truly think that's the day the world changed for the worse. It was a huge traumatic event broadcast in real time to the world and then used as a reason for so much injustice, but it also sowed a seed in many 'normal' people for an us-and-them mentality.
