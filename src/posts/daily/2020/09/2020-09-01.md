Up at 5am for a train to Crewe, then cycling into Snowdonia for a few days cycling. One or two observations:

- This is the first time I've had to write a daily post 100% on my phone, and it's really a faff. I need to come up with a better process.
- The trains I used were spotless. Someone was literally cleaning it end to end, over and over, for the whole journey.
- Someone of my fitness has no business doing 75 (mostly) Welsh miles with luggage, let alone over Horseshoe Pass. I was utterly broken after.
- Getting into a hotel room, closing the door behind me and having absolute silence was exactly what I needed.

Travel is something I have really missed; pre-COVID I'd be abroad at least once a year but just travelling to London for a day counted far more than I realised. I think I'm going to see much more of the UK asa result of this. I already have some ideas.

PS: Yes. I really need to work on mobile posting as I managed to cancel the file creation the first time and lost the whole post. Which may explain the lazy bullet point lost for today.
