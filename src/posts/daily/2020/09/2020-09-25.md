Friday morning ritual. Wake up a little later than usual, immediately check Spotify for new releases, get irritated by the concept of singles on a streaming service (really, why?), find a few albums and add them to playlists so I remember to listen.

Today saw the arrival of a new Deftones album, Ohms. I'm not going to say I'm the biggest fan of them, though White Pony is in my top 100 albums and I genuinely love it, but they have been making inoffensively heavy music for a very long time and are always reliable. I'd rate this one as their best since White Pony.

I realise I have stalled on the 'discogs' series of posts, but with travelling and the return of covid, bike building, and still trying to find my feet with work it just wasn't something I had much time to do. I'm leaving my weekend deliberately empty so I'll be able to get back on top of it.
