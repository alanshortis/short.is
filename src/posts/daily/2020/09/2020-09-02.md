Rain is different in Wales. It permeates everything, making a mockery of the expensive technical rain gear you were so sure would keep you dry.

There were moments today where the raindrops felt like needles, where the wind was so fierce it was actually hard to breathe. It sounds grim, well, it _was_ grim, but I donâ€™t think the route would have had quite as much drama had it been a still, dry day.

[Stwlan Dam](https://veloviewer.com/segment/1398283) is just 1.7 miles at an average of 9.7%, but this followed a good amount of climbing just to get to the start of the gated road; this is a service road for the dam and is closed to cars which makes it one of the finest climbs I have ever done. Towards the top there is a series of switchbacks which is pretty rare in the UK, and as the views out over the valley and of another dam below it's an incredibly dramatic backdrop.

I've walked in Wales a lot, and I would fairly often camp beside Llyn Gwynant so I know that valley quite well. Today was the first time I'd cycled that way, and the [Nant Gwynant](https://veloviewer.com/segment/725570/Nant+Gwynant) climb was as beautiful as I imagined despite the horrific rain. I continued all the way up to Pen-y-pas which is best know as the starting point for a lot of the routes to the top of Snowdon.
