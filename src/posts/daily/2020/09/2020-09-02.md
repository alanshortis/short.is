Rain is different in Wales. It permeates everything, making a mockery of the expensive technical rain gear you were so sure would keep you dry.

There were moments today where the raindrops felt like needles, where the wind was so fierce it was actually hard to breathe. It sounds grim, well, it _was_ grim, but i donâ€™t think the route would have had quite as much drama had it been a still, dry day.
