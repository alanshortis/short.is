70 miles on the bike, totally flat route, lovely sunny day. No problem - I can do that without much thought and it'll be good to be outside.

Except I didn't check the wind speed and direction. The last 30 miles were absolute misery. What's more, it's almost always like this when I ride out towards Lincolnshire yet somehow I didn't pause and think.

Cycling is stupid. It takes ages and it's really hard. Why didn't I choose snooker or darts?
