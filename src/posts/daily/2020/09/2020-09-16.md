The Queen stage of the Tour de France today covered some roads I've ridden more than once and while stats always hammer home just how far beyond professionals are, seeing them on familiar climbs ploughing on with minimal effort is extremely humbling.

The commentary team for Eurosport is made up of a core of 5 presenters, ranging from former riders who can give tactical insights to commentators who are well versed in just filling space. A lot of the time, races have long periods where not much is happening so they'll throw to someone whose sole purpose is to talk about the various chateaus and give a recipe of the day.

This is why I love the Tour so much. There are more interesting races for sure, but none have the added dimension of a tourist film for a genuinely beautiful country.
