It's pretty easy for Tour de France stages to be pretty boring and this certainly true of time trials. With up to 176 riders setting off one-by-one, removing the interplay in the bunch and the clock being what separates winners from losers, you're usually better off watching highlights or just looking up the result.

That was true for the majority of the riders left today, but very far from it for the GC hopefuls. Richie Porte riding to a podium for the stage to get a podium overall despite starting the day with a huge deficit to Miguel Angel Lopez was impressive enough but for the yellow jersey to change hands on the final stage was absolutely incredible.

Primož Roglič has a healthy lead of 57 seconds over Tadej Pogačar and while there was expectation that the gap could shrink, no one expected that gap to be reversed. Pogačar will ride into Paris tomorrow with a 59 second lead.

Roglič is part of the strongest team - Lotto Jumbo - with former World TT champion Tom Dumoulin and all-round mega-talent Wout Van Aert who both also placed very high on the day, but as Pogačar kept opening up a gap their faces were pictures of shock and incredulity.

Truly a historic day for cycling.
