As my new gravel bike nears completion (though since covid started, supply of bikes and components has been stretched and as such I can't find any brakes) I have started to think about what I could do with it.

There is a lot to ride locally, and going a little further afield there is a huge amount to explore in the Peak District. I cannot resist looking at maps and making far fetched plans, and this led me to read about [Cime de Caron](https://www.dangerousroads.org/europe/france/5938-cime-de-caron.html), a gravel pass in the Alps that tops out at 3,182m.

There is a village called Orelle where I have based myself for cycling a couple of times. It's very quiet, and located in the Marienne valley where many iconic cycling climbs start. Also in the Alps, Val Thorens is the highest ski resort in Europe and the road leading to it from the north is one of the longest climbs I have ever completed.

These places are in adjacent valleys, and Cime de Caron sits above both. It's possible to ride between them, mostly off road.

It won't be 2021, it may not be 2022, but I will do this one day.
