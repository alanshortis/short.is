Early on in my time at HMV, there was a hard core of staff members who were massively into _underground_ hip-hop from labels like Rhymesayers, Def Jux, and Anticon. For some reason Sage Francis seemed to be at the centre of this.

[Makeshift Patriot EP](https://www.discogs.com/Sage-Francis-The-Makeshift-Patriot-EP/release/1802141) sounds close to his series of 'Sick' mixtapes, which for me were always miles ahead of the legit studio albums in every way; lyrical content, performance, even production. The title track is a post-911 call to resist the stripping of rights in the wake of the disaster. While it feels slightly naive nearly 20 years later, it's probably Sage's finest moment. 'We don't really know who the culprit is yet, but he looks like this'.

[Personal Journals](https://www.discogs.com/Sage-Francis-Personal-Journals/release/140098) is one of the best albums Anticon ever released. While it's far from perfect, Sage's lyrics and flow are really strong. The array of producers is just incredible, with Odd Nosdam (a personal favourite), Sixtoo, Jel, Mr. Dibbs... It's really a who's who of talent from that period of time. And yet, even with all these different voices they all clearly understood the sound that was required; you can never see the seams.
