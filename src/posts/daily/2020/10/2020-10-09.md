[Slow Riot For New Zero Kanada E.P.](https://www.discogs.com/Godspeed-You-Black-Emperor-Slow-Riot-For-New-Zero-Kanada-EP/release/79945) by Godspeed You Black Emperor! might be my favourite release of theirs. It's very tight, concentrated, pure Godspeed with no filler at all. Using spoken word over the music isn't a new thing for this bad, but on BBF3 it feels as if the music has been tailored to the sample and isn't just a feature of it. An older man tells of his disdain for the government, a judge, and recites some social commentary disguised as poetry while the music rises and falls with his emotion.

The first side, Moya, is instrumental and really takes its time to build, going 5 minutes until any drums kick in, pushing the piece forwards. This side is 45rpm, but I often listen to it at 33 making it longer darker and even more dramatic as all the instruments appear downtuned.
