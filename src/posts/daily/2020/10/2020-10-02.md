I really do not like The Flaming Lips. I could probably listen to The Soft Bulletin through and not totally hate every moment of it, but aside from that I just can't abide how _wet_ the music is and how weak Wayne Coyne's voice is. 'Do You Realize??' is a horrible, horrible song. The idea of people choosing this for funeral music is disturbing to me.

So, it makes no sense to me at all that I own [At War With The Mystics](https://www.discogs.com/The-Flaming-Lips-At-War-With-The-Mystics/release/752002) and the lead single, [It Overtakes Me](https://www.discogs.com/The-Flaming-Lips-It-Overtakes-Me/release/1180601). Admittedly, the cover of the gatefold is pretty nice. A splash of colour containing a heavy weight bright orange records. But I don't like a moment of what's inside.
