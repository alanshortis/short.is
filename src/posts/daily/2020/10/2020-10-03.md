I don't think Flying Lotus has made a bad album. And with appearances from Thundercat and Thom Yorke, [Cosmogramma](https://www.discogs.com/Flying-Lotus-Cosmogramma/release/2253877) is no exception. End to end it's lavishly produced, in places sounding really organic and natural which is hard to do on an electronic album.

'MmmHmm' sounds just like Thundercat's solo work, almost constructed like a slow ballad but with an urgent beat overlaid, pushing it forwards and disguising how heartfelt the vocals are.
