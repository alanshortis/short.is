I got to Parliament/Funkadelic late, getting into Bernie Worrell via Les Claypool and Stop Making Sense before finding my way to [Free Your Mind... And Your Ass Will Follow](https://www.discogs.com/Funkadelic-Free-Your-Mind-And-Your-Ass-Will-Follow/release/1798884). It as not the album I was expecting; far more abstract and conceptual than the straight funk I had hoped for, but this wasn't a disappointment. Not even slightly.

It's the only George Clinton I own, and Maggot Brain has been on my wish list for a long time. Buying more records isn't a high priority right now as much as I love them. Actually, as I see the collection value grow on discogs I occasionally wonder if this meagre collection is even worth maintaining.
