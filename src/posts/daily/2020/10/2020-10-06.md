No time for vinyl today. It was a headphones-and-code kind of day.

Ask any front end developer what the worst part of the job is and most will tell you it's dealing with older browsers. The biggest irritation with IE11 is that it technically does support a lot of modern features, but either supports old specifications or it has bugs that cannot be worked around. This makes feature detection really difficult.

To get around it, I used a CSS media query that only exists in IE10 and 11, so checking for a match will identify IE and be harmless elsewhere. It's still code that needs a comment to explain it, and for me, that's a sign of failure.

Up to IE10, there was the concept of conditional comments. These could be used to reliably identify specific versions of Internet Explorer and the fact that this was removed for IE10 and IE11 just shows the arrogance of Microsoft at the time. So sure that they'd finally made a good browser, _why would anyone need to treat out browser differently?_.
