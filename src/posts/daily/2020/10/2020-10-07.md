With winter creeping in it's time to think about cycling. It's a choice between enduring bad weather and the resulting wear and tear on the bike, or being bored and extremely sweaty on the indoor trainer.

The answer is probably a bit of both. I don't particularly like riding at night, so evenings during the week will be hard, focussed training sessions indoors. The weekend will be a long ride outdoors, whatever the weather.

I write a while ago about doing a month fully focussed. It didn't happen, much to the surprise of absolutely no one. I have a strong desire to be as fit as I can manage for next spring and summer, but recently I haven't wanted to ride at all.

Cycling encouraged pressure and obligation to train. You get scared you'll be left behind and less fit than your friends. You need to show everyone how strong you are at all times. I'm not doing that; I'm giving myself a break for now, on the understanding that I get dedicated soon.
