After tinkering and waiting for parts, the new bike is finished. The industry calls it a Gravel Bike; it's not as aggressive as a cycle cross bike, but it's also not a mountain bike as it has drop bars. It's probably closet to what Tomac rode in the early days of MTB, except with huge wheels.

I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this bike is fast and fun. It just keeps rolling, feels extremely stiff and responsive, comfortable, and it even sprints.

I've been told that within 6 months I'll have sold my road bikes and gone over to the multi-purpose bike world, where gravel isn't scary, people are less competitive and things are generally more fun. I don't know about that; my love for high mountain passes isn't going away so road bikes will always be a factor. But. When I was riding mountain bikes fairly seriously I never once went out to train. I just went for a ride with my friends, sometimes far, sometimes to the same series of bomb holes in the woods, but always with a smile. I'd like that again.
