Everyone knew Ninja Tune and Warp, so in the spirit of a little oneupmanship you'd have to go looking for other little labels putting out good hip-hop or electronic music. This led to Grand Central Records and Fingathing.

[And The Big Red Nebula Band](https://www.discogs.com/Fingathing-And-The-Big-Red-Nebula-Band/release/253193) and [Superhero Music](https://www.discogs.com/Fingathing-Superhero-Music/release/5498146) are the two albums I have, and you'd be amazed at how well they have both aged. Say 'early 2000s duo comprised of a DJ and a classically trained double bassist' and you'd rightly assume the worst, but both are amazing.

I hadn't thought about Fingathing for easily 15 years even with both of these double albums on the shelf, but it was BBC 6 Music that got me back into them, playing them not during some specialist show but at 11am on a week day. Maybe if I listened to the radio more often I'd be reminded of other great bands that have all but vanished.
