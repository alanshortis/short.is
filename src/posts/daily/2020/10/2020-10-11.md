Good for working to, GoGo Penguin - [A Humdrum Star](https://www.discogs.com/GoGo-Penguin-A-Humdrum-Star/release/11537129) is the kind of album I'd put on to help me concentrate on work. Consistent-volume instrumental music is perfect for that, but playing 4 sides of an album on a turntable is definitely not conducive to productivity. This was certainly from Rough Trade in Nottingham, and certainly a I-just-want-to-buy-something kind of purchase.

Having said that, I do really like Jazz trios. Actually, trios of any kind are really appealing to me, with there being the bare minimum of musicians to get a full spectrum. Like Rush and Primus, GoGo Penguin sound extremely full with that core of members and nothing else.
