Like yesterday, it's another impulse buy with Jon Hopkins - [Singularity](https://www.discogs.com/Jon-Hopkins-Singularity/release/11950639). It's a really good album, but I have no idea why I felt the need to buy it. It's deep and complex and full of atmosphere but, again, I'd pull this up on Spotify but I'm far less likely to deal with the turntable. I don't walk past Rough Trade on my way home from work anymore so these kinds of purchases are far more scarce.

[Donuts](https://www.discogs.com/J-Dilla-Donuts/release/619872). This is it. Probably the finest collection of hip-hop instrumentals there is, and J Dilla's last release before his death on his 32nd birthday. There are more ideas, creative uses of samples, and true classics in here than in some artists whole careers, a fact made even more remarkable considering all but two of the tracks were produced while he was in hospital. A few of these have popped up on albums with an emcee, but unlike a lot of instrumental albums, at no point do I feel like vocals would really add anything. I bought this at Rough Trade in New York, and it has a little bit of damage to sleeve from cramming it into my case for the flight home.

I wouldn't be a white hip-hop fan of a certain age without at least one Jurassic 5 album, and [Quality Control](https://www.discogs.com/Jurassic-5-Quality-Control/release/3277887) is the one. This group was a gateway for a lot of people I knew, along with DJ Shadow, to hip-hop fandom from a more rock focussed taste. The skill of the emcees is undeniable, but it's always been all about Nu Mark and Cut Chemist's production and turn table skills. There aren't many albums as tight as this.
