Today, I deleted every tweet, reply and like I've ever made. I unfollowed more than 500 accounts across twitter and instagram. I'm now trying to figure out how to delete everything in Facebook, but it'll be a surprise to exactly no one that Facebook make this pretty hard to do in bulk.

Why not just delete my accounts entirely?

- Twitter can be a helpful source of information. There is a very large developer community, and while it can be full of horrible opinions, politics and shit posting, I have genuinely learned a lot there. On the flip side, some notable and 'famous' developers have been extremely rude to me there over the years for daring to question opinions or attempt to explain something. I don't want that. I also had an interview recently where they mentioned my 'controversial' opinions on React and I was forced to back up my argument that, yes, one day we'll treat React with the same disdain people now have for jQuery. It's not a solution. It's a band-aid.

- Instagram _can_ be very good if you're disciplined with who you follow and avoid that discover tab at all costs. 'Reels' is hell. It's so absolutely dire.

- Facebook is how everything in my cycling club is managed unfortunately. The dedicated app for groups is now dead, so en empty account with zero interactions is the best I can manage.
