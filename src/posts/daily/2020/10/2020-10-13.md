When assigned a task at work, I'll read the description. If it's a change to a user interface, I'll be able to visualise a solution very quickly, implement it, then move on. If the task is more back end focussed (recently, changes to the way cookies are set) I'll put it off.

Any chores around the house, reviewing other people's code, even timesheets will jump ahead in priority. Just as things are getting to the point where there is an expectation that some work should be ready for review, I'll take a look at the description. I'll just _see_ if I can maybe make sense of it. And, more often than not, I have either completed the task or at least come up with an approach pretty quickly.

I'm so certain I'll fail that I am deliberately putting tasks off. Delaying the inevitable, trying to enjoy the time before I'm stuck and trying to rack my brains. But it's never that bad.

I have such low self-worth, it leads to self sabotage. If the task truly was difficult, all I'm doing is giving myself even less time and even more pressure to perform.
