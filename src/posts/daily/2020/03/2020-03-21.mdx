There are two camps on twitter (not in general, I mean for the example I'm about to give): people who are saying that they're going to try and use isolation and a potential lock down as an opportunity to do things they've been neglecting, and those who tell them that, no, they won't do that despite best intentions.

I think I may fall somewhere between the two. I have plenty of ideas of things I know I'm not doing that I should be, so I'm going to do them. Daily writing is just one of those things and today marks a full week since I started. On the other hand, my reading has dropped off significantly thanks to the removal of my commute and my tendency during the first week of working from home to stay up late writing the code that I didn't write during the day because of slack meetings and procrastination.

I'm making myself a promise right now to try and stay productive, try and find and focus on some positives while everything can seem hopeless, but also to give myself a break when I choose to devote a day to Red Dead Redemption instead of _self improvement_.
