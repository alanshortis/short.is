Before everything changed I had some plans for travel this year. Plans I was really excited for.

- June: Toronto, to see Primus perform the entirety of the Rush album, A Farewell to Kings.
- July: The French Alps for Marmotte Granfondo Alpes.
- September: Osaka and Tokyo.

Neither of the June or July events have been officially cancelled yet but it's only a matter of time. It's a shame, but the Primus tour may well just be postponed a year. As for the Marmotte, this will be the second time I have entered and not been able to attend. Maybe it's just not meant to be?

Japan was in early stages of planning and I hadn't yet booked anything aside from the time off work. I have a document with loose plans and a timetable and all of that still applies. I just need to wait. While September feels like a long way away, I'm becoming more convinced by the day that we're going to be in this for at least six months.

Something I have always loved to do is make plans. I have cycling routes and a good understanding of the geography of a lot of places I have never been, and that's not going to stop. When this is over and we can again travel freely I am going to take a long and ambitious trip, and until then I can enjoy the research and evenings spent looking at maps.
