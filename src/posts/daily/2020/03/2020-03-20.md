Who people really are is being revealed because of this situation.

Some people are continuing to buy what they need when they need it, practice social distancing and look out for those among us who are more vulnerable or less able to help themselves.

Others are buying more than they need and continuing to visit pubs and restaurants, ignoring steps that will help to prevent further spread.

I find the lack of true direction from the government disturbing. _Suggesting_ people stay at home while not mandating it will mean people who don't want to be at home will just go out. People whose income is at risk will keep using busy public transport to get to work before that work dries up. Not everyone is ignorant, some people have little to no choice.

We need truly decisive action because a lot of people simply aren't thoughtful enough to consider how their actions may harm other people.
