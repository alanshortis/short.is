My timing for starting the daily writing could have been better. At a time where I am mostly confined to my house with very little to do aside from work it's hard to find anything to say.

The total re-write of my website is going well, with separate sections for my writing and for daily writing. I'm using Gatsby again, but I still have this feeling that it's a little heavy handed, with there being a series of GraphQL queries being required to get data where I need it. I'm trying to choose between SCSS and Styled Components and I have no idea which one I want to use.

I collected some scanned film, all the photos being from more than 10 years ago. A few gems among a lot of totally worthless snapshots. Some were medum format, others were 35mm shot on a Leica M6 I was lucky enough to borrow from my girlfriend at the time. I think she had two of them.
