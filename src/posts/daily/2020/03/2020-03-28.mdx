Up early today to go cycling. Still feeling a little torn on outdoor riding but I have set a few constraints on distance and terrain - no further than 40 miles, trying to keep out of any urban areas and no long/fast descents. Also waiting a little longer at junctions than usual as it's safe to assume anyone driving at the moment is exhausted.

I'm riding what I'm calling the winter bike. A 2015 Ridley Helium with Campagnolo Chorus EPS, Campagnolo Scirocco wheels and Deda parts to finish. The 'summer' bike is pretty much the same but everything taken up a notch: 2019 Ridley Helium SL, Campagnolo Super Record EPS, Campagnolo Bora 50/35 wheels and marginally better Deda parts. With the weather being so good recently I really should fit some bar tape and chain and start using it.

But then again, maybe I stick with the older of the two for the time being and save the wear on the more expansive parts? Or more accurately, wait until have the form to justify it. It can be a bit embarrassing at times.
