I've been thinking about the government response to the COVID-19 crisis, and with my extremely limited understanding of politics something became quite clear: The measures put in place to protect people are extremely socialist, and the conservative government we have has been pushed to it.

It's definitely a good thing that people's incomes are going to be protected, but I can't help but feel that it's only now that millions of middle class people are in need that this has happened. There are many people who have lived with illness and precarious income for most of their lives and they're routinely ignored or scapegoated.

I'd love to think that out of this people will have a better understanding of what daily life is like for the poor and disabled and be more kind, empathetic and understanding. The more likely outcome is that in order to recover from a deep recession that will follow we will see austerity measures with the poor once again making the biggest sacrifices while the rich escape.

I recently finished [Lost Connections: Why Youâ€™re Depressed and How to Find Hope](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lost-Connections-Youre-Depressed-Find/dp/1408878720) by Johann Hari and in the final chapter he touches on the idea of a universal basic income. At the time I wondered if this would really work, but I am now more and more convinced that this should definitely happen. People's basic needs would be covered, the money would mostly be spent and go right back into the economy, and the resources needed to manage the current benefits system could likely be reduced. It's huge subject, and I really hope in the wake of this crisis it becomes something that is seriously considered.
