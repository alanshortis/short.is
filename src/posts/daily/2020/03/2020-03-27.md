The whole thing still feels like a surreal dream, but today it felt extremely real and immediate as I needed to go out and pick up some food. There was a queue to get in, with everyone 2 meters apart down the road. They only let people in as people left, keeping a maximum of 10 people in the store at any one time. Staff and customers in masks. No toilet paper, hand soap or disinfectant to be seen.

Lockdown has been in place for a matter of days. I don't know how things look in a matter of months.
