In the last 24 hours I have been both good and bad. I managed to get myself out cycling and managed 28 miles of slow, solo riding purely to be outside. Following that, I started to write a small Node.js app and a new post about the thinking and process of putting together.

Today, though, despite waking up at 8am I managed to stay in bed until 3pm. Not even eating or drinking anything, wondering what could be causing headache and looking at total garbage online.

The news is making me feel sick. The endless string of tweets or hot takes are pissing me off. The posts from celebrities trying to make it appear that this crisis is the same for us all are enraging.

I didn't think about any of those things while I was cycling or writing. Mostly because I wasn't looking at social media or the news.
