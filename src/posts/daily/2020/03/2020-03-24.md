Although careful never to use the work 'lockdown', Boris yesterday declared that all non-essential retail businesses must close and going outdoors is only permitted for food, medicine, and one form of exercise per day.

The good news in this (for me, at least) is that this mirrors the measures I had imposed on myself anyway, but it has me extremely conflicted.

It may be acceptable to continue cycling outdoors alone as I was before but is it _morally_ correct? I am always cautious, and have been even more so that usual over the last few days but it doesn't take much for a small incident to lead to injury, injury to lead to the need for medical assistance, and for that assistance to be diverting someone away from people infected.

I genuinely have no idea what to do. I definitely need to continue to go outdoors and I won't stop walking every day but cycling is different. It'll maintain what form I have, it'll keep me out for longer periods and the distance that can be covered has a truly healing property.
