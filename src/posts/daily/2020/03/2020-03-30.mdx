I'm good at planning. Getting everything I need in line so that I can do what needs to be done effectively. The execution bit? Not so much.

With it looking increasingly like a long period of social distancing becoming a very long period it's safe to assume that a summer of cycling is not happing in 2020. So naturally I switch to planning. 'If I get myself sorted now, I have a whole year of gains before summer 2021'. It's fairly sound logic; the cycling club I am a member of gets fast and competitive over the summer months so could I use this to my advantage and go into 2021 swinging?

It's not an exaggeration to say that I have been in a cycle of 'I need to do X' and then not doing X properly, for 20 years. Is this an opportunity to redeem myself? Am I going to execute it and not just pat myself on the back for best intentions?
