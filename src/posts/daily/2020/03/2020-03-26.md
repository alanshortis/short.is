Between 2006 and 2010 I went to the USA 5 times to see Les Claypool (Primus) perform in some variation, and to meet people I'd known via the Primus message board (Bullboard) since 1997.

In those years I saw 12 shows across 8 US states and 3 different bands, but also once in Cologne, twice in London, and three times in Amsterdam.

Since 2010 I have only managed three more shows, all in London.

The reason for that large drop off is down to my relationship status and shifting interests, with planned solo trips being to the Alps to cycle rather than a handful of cities. I am single and my love for cycling is dwindling so I can see more shows in my future. If this years Primus tour is postponed to 2021 I think I'll try and see some other shows while out there.

I've seen 21 Les Claypool shows. I think I'd like to get 100.
