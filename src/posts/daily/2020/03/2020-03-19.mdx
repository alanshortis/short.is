I live alone, and I live in a city where I have no family and limited close friends. I am mostly fine with this and I value time alone, but there is a huge difference between choosing to isolate and it being forced.

We do not have mandatory isolation yet, but I'm beginning to think it should happen. I am going out for a walk at lunch every day and people simply are not practicing social distancing. Coffee shops and pubs are still busy, people are still crammed on to public transport and after buying more than they need are still standing close in queues.

I've heard from a number of people asking that I keep in touch and it's been really comforting to know that people are there, even if it has to be virtually for now.
