In February 2019 I staretd writing every day in an attept to add some accountability and to make myself look at what I do more closely. I managed it for about 5 weeks (better than I expected) but never published it anywhere. In that time it evolved from a daily rundown of the previous day into writing on thoughts and ideas that I'd had buzzing around my head. I think it'll be a mixture this time.

I'm trying this again because a few things have developed that have made me want to be more conscious and take better care of myself:

- Last week I had a mental health assessment and the diagnosis was fairly shocking: Major depression, PTSD, and minor anxiety. I think I knew, deep down, but having a professional confirm it was quite hard to hear.
- The COVID-19 pandemic is escalating. Initially I thought the response and media coverage was vastly overblown, but I don't feel that way now.
- I'm losing the love for a lot of things I do. I used to love writing code. I used to love cycling. Now each of those things feel like a chore.

Last time I set myself some rules. I've written some new ones:

- Write something every day, no matter how little.
- No need to publish every day if it's not possible but post from your phone if necessary.
- This doesn't replace [writing](/writing) on technical subjects, and they don't count as daily posts.
- Let posts be boring. Most days they probably will be.
- Don't write for an audience, write for yourself.

None of this will be published just yet - I'll be adding the new 'daily' section in v3 of [short.is](/) so until then they'll live in a branch in GitHub.

Extra rule: Not all posts need an ending.
