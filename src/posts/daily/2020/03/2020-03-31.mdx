This post contains light spoilers for Better Call Saul.

A lot of people consider Breaking Bad to be the best TV show of all time. I think Better Call Saul is better. Far better. But that's only possible _because_ of Breaking Bad. Knowing where certain characters end up makes the development of the story fascinating. More than that, not knowing what happens to her makes me worry. Does she die? Does she go to prison? Does she just leave? Her and Jimmy are married?!

I didn't particularly like Saul Goodman as a character in Breaking Bad but this series makes me appreciate him more even in the story that follows this prequel. I can't think of any other series that so perfectly influence each other while also being able to stand alone. While BCS would be a little confusing without knowing BB, it would still be very watchable. Especially if you like a perfectly executed montage.
