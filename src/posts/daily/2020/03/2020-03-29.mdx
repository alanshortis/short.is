I've never been much of a gamer, which I am frequently reminded is rare for a developer, but aside from the obvious non-gamer games that everyone likes on some level (GTA, Red Dead Redemption) a game that I will never tire of is Portal 2.

The first time I played I found it to be extremely frustrating but also very rewarding and satisfying when I finally managed to complete a test. The pacing of the game is perfect, with enough testing at the beginning that when you move from tests to navigating the bowels of the facility it all feels natural.

It doesn't surprise me that there hasn't yet been a third installment. The mechanics of the game are so vast and complex I can't fathom how it would be planned, written and executed. I remain hopeful though as there are few things as relaxing as an hour or two of test chambers, complete with the subtle soundtrack and deadpan putdowns from GLadOS. Well. Relaxing now. There was a time I wanted to throw the console in the bin and forget the game ever existed.
