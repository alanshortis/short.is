Balancing days off work is going to be difficult. I want to use my free time to improve in any way I can but I also need to respect that rest and doing nothing has value to avoid both burnout and overtraining. It feels ridiculous to be thinking of overtraining as an issue. I've been very slack on cycling and working on my core strength and stability at home.

I last cycled 2 weeks ago and after getting home I was sure I didn't want to do it anymore. High winds have been constant, the roads are in terrible condition and it takes up such a huge amount of time.

I'm entered into the Marmotte Alpes in July and it looks very likely it'll be cancelled based on what's happened with many other events. Part of me hope that doesn't happen, part of me really hopes it does. But it's not just cycling, I'm having trouble enjoying near enough anything right now.
