Injury is the worst thing for anyone that does any kind of sport even slightly seriously. To make it worse, I woke up a few days ago with knee pain and I have no idea why. No cycling this weekend to avoid making things worse, and I've liked the opportunity to not need to do it for a legitimate reason, not feeling like I'm slacking off.

I've been in my house for 6 months and in that time I have neglected a stack of chores. Plants still in plastic pots, a shower door that's been harder and harder to open, weeding and arranging tools into the tool chest that has a jammed drawer.

I got most of that done while still allowing time to vegetate on the sofa with episodes of The Wire, looking for more plants to buy to turn the house into a jungle.
