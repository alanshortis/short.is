Route planning on [Strava](https://blog.strava.com/routes/)\* is one of my favourite ways to pass time. I've made many routes in parts of the world I've never been, and have no solid plans to go to. Cross-checking with street view and satellite images to check that roads are passable. Roads I am unlikely to ever actually ride.

Tonight I put together a route from Los Angeles to San Francisco via Yosemite, making sure to pass El Capitan, some desert, some sequoias. Trying to put together a perfect route without the burden of logistics and the practicalities of hundreds of miles between the starting and finishing points.

Before Strava I'd buy paper maps of the Swiss Alps, Wales, or Scotland looking for hidden gems or areas I'd like to visit. How would I get between those areas, where are the stations, shops and campsites.

Of those places, I only ever went to Wales. Once we're able to travel again, I need to do better at following through on the endless planning.

\* Can we take a moment to appreciate that blog post about Strava's route planning? That's what I'd like to be building as a front end developer, please.
