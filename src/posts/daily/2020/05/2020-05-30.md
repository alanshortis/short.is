I took a longer ride today, alone of course, into the Peak District. 75 miles always used to be a pretty manageable distance for me but over the last few months I've been sitting down a lot. I've not been eating as well as I could. And being a little _older_ means my fitness just vanishes if I don't keep on top of it.

There are three people I like riding with a lot. We've been to Belgium, Germany, France and Luxembourg together, with Luxembourg being possibly the most amazing place we've ever ridden. The plan is to complete a 500 mile loop through northern Europe next summer, carrying our gear and sleeping outside. There is also talk of riding from Las Vegas to Los Angeles, via Yosemite. That would be north of 900 miles and pass through the lowest and highest points of California; approximately a 10,000ft difference.

I really want to do these rides. And while today's moderate distance just about finished me off, I know that this is how I want to see the world. The training will be worth it.
