Attempting to fill my house up with as many plants as possible. If I can't leave the place as often as I'd like I might as well turn it into a jungle.

There are a lot of online store dedicated to selling houseplants. In plastic, with pots sold separately leading to a small to medium plant in a pot costing upwards of Â£40. The same thing could be picked up from B&Q for a quarter of that at best.

The only thing these online stores have going for them is that they still deliver, so I may just need to suck it up and pay for the sake my own jungle. I want to need a machete to get to the kitchen.
