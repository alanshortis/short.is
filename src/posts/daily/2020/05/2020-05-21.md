In the very late 90s to the very early 2000s, mountain bikes were my thing. I used to race a few times a year in the Southern Area Mountainbike Series and while I was never very good I used to love racing downhill. This was when it was still totally possible to do it on a hard tail, as long as you knew you'd never do very well.

I raced XC too, and would often pass a few people when the course used parts of the DH course from the day before, but even 20 years ago I couldn't climb. Some things never change.

Today I took the road bike on some forest trails and it's the first off road riding I have done for years. I absolutely loved the challenge of the terrain on very much the wrong bike, and I still seem to have a good feel for that predictable-yet-scary lack of grip in places, but considering I was on 28mm slicks it never felt too secure.

I would love to be in a position to justify another bike, and even then I don't know if it'd be a drop-bar gravel/CX bike or a 29er MTB. I kind of need one of each.
