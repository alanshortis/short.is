Videos of people singing 'we'll meet again' or doing a conga as part of the VE celebrations have been doing the rounds. Dressed up as some kind of uplifting, blitz spirit, feel good moment we can all bond over.

Fuck that. People thinking they don't need to adhere to rules that have been set for the good of everyone.
