I think most people know at least one person with a chip on their shoulder. Someone who, for instance, is so set on commenting on certain people that they become much more irritating than the people they're trying to put down.

Who's worse; the overly stylish, possibly stereotypical designer or developer, or the person so keep to label them a hipster and poke fun at their choices and interests?
