It's a strange thing when someone leaves their job. Everyone is complementary, disappointed and sad to see that person go, or at least that's what they say.

It's hard to separate the person from how effective they are in their role, but I've been trying to do that today. I've found this person difficult to work with and I truly believe they have effected my feeling towards my career for the worse. But, you can't say that when someone is leaving. It's best to be pleasant, wish them well and try to focus on how things may improve.

Not only that, your experience of them almost certainly doesn't align with everyone else, and there will be people genuinely sad. It's not the time to make it about you, because it isn't. It's nothing personal either; I'm sure people have found me difficult in the past, and I hope I'm improving on that with each new employer and team.
