Supposedly there will be a relaxing of the lockdown this Monday. I truly cannot believe that this is going to happen; the death rate is higher now than it was at the start, and doesn't show much sign of any meaningful reduction. Italy, France and Spain, all at some time ridiculed by our press, have much lower rates and their relaxed lockdowns are more strict than ours ever was.

Speaking of the press, they must have been briefed on these plans as today's headlines were celebrating some kind of victory. The Sun proclaimed 'Happy Monday'.

Imagine being an NHS worker or a relative of someone who has died and seeing that headline?

Imagine trying to claim some kind of Blitz Spirit one week, then displaying ridiculous glee at the prospect of a beer garden being open the next.
