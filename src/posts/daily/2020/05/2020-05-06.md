The comparisons to past tragedies has started. I have seen the same observation on twitter a number of times - that the body count of 9/11 is nothing compared to the COVID deaths in the USA and yet the response is barely there. People almost want more of it.

The attack on the world trade centre was the ultimate world news event - horror unfolding quickly on the news, loud and powerful imagery, fire. A pandemic moves more slowly, the horror is behind closed doors and largely unseen. Not dissimilar to heart disease or cancer, when the consequences are slow moving people are less likely to react.

You could include gun violence in this weird horror-blindness, but that won't change either. Owning a gun and being able to get a haircut is worth the deaths in the eyes of many Americans. Ironically, 9/11 stripped many Americans of a much more fundamental but less visible freedom for many in the form of the patriot act.
