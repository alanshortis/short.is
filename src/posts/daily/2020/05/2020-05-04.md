Am I doing too much? I have no idea what to write about today, and the last few days have been a real struggle to get anything down which has led to me writing about not knowing what to write about, which really... You can only do that once.

I'm keeping up with Duolingo, now over 40 day streak on German, and when the bass I have ordered has arrived I'm hoping to get an hour in a day. So while that may provide some scope for writing, it also takes up writing time.

My fear is that I'll decide to stop writing and lose the streak, then have things to say. Does the streak really matter? Isn't writing when I feel like it more important than some arbitrary day count?

This is day 50, and that's a long time. I had no idea if it would get easier as time went on, or more difficult. The habit is defintely formed but finding ideas and avoiding repetition is a daily struggle.

Exploring themes, either as a series or per day? Writing about what I am learning? Maybe recounting past experiences apropos of nothing? All options.
