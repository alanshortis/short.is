Last year I stayed in an Airbnb in Luxembourg that had so many houseplants it was clear that if the owner ever moved they'd either need to gives the plants to the new owner, or cut them back a huge amount in order to get them out the building.

Since then, I've moved into a place with a little more space and the goal is to fill it with plants. I only have some small to medium plants (7), succulents and cacti (6), but plant to get some plants that will grow huge as soon as I can. The previous inhabitant was nice enough to leave a hook in the bathroom ceiling so a hanging _thing_ is a priority.

Garden centres are technically open now, but the queues are huge and it's unlikely they'll have a good range of plants and pots. The focus is on essentials. The alternative is one of a few online stores that offer subscriptions and one-off purchases, but these are routinely three times more expensive before you even get to postage.

My home jungle will need to wait for the time being.
