I've been using Gatsby for this site (both what's live and a total rewrite) and I'm considering dropping it. While it provides a pretty fast site out the box, PWA, access to APIs etc, I just feel like it's far too complex for my purposes.

I think 11ty is a good candidate. Truly static. Far simpler. Less JavaScript.

I'm more and more keen on less JavaScript.
