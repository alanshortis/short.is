Strava. If you cycle, you know what it is and you more than likely upload each ride you do to keep track of distance, and maybe you're also interested in the segment leader boards.

Those leader boards are one of a few features that were previously free but have now been moved to the premium membership level. Naturally, there is some outrage about this.

The sense of entitlement is kind of sickening; this is a service that logs and stores vast amounts of data, and it's not a surprise to me that they have never been profitable. More than 50 million members, many uploading rides and creating routes multiple times a week, leads to a lot of data that needs to be stored, parsed, and transferred. That's not cheap.

The comparisons to Twitter and Facebook are unfounded - these sites may be 'free' at the point of use but they sell and use the data you provide for advertising. Running ads on Strava was roundly rejected by the community, and the idea of data that is _very_ sensitive being sold or monitised in itself is obviously horrifying.

The idea of someone on a £10k Colnago sat on top of a £1k smart trainer while wearing Assos or Rapha kit getting riled up about paying £4 a month for a service they use to validate themselves on a daily basis is hilarious.
