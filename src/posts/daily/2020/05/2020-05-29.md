No one wants a violent form of protest. If the response to Colin Kaepernick kneeling in peaceful protest hadn't been the president calling him a 'Son of a Bitch', maybe it wouldn't have been needed.

White people protesting the lockdown while carrying their faux combat gear and automatic weapons, claiming they cannot breathe when wearing a mask.

A black male telling a police officer who is kneeling on his neck that he cannot breathe, before calling out for his mother. His mother who had already passed away. He knew he was going to die.

Riot is a legitimate form of protest, especially when peaceful options have been exhausted. It's terrifying how deep racism runs in the USA more than 50 years after Martin Luther King was assasinated.

I appreciate this a bit of a ramble. I don't know what to say or do. It's all just so disgusting.
