I saw a take on twitter that said the cause of a lot of mental anguish at the moment may be down to there being no 'tomorrow'. There aren't shows, travel or even proper socialising to look forward to, just endless 'today'.

I'm not sure I agree entirely. It's not that we don't have a tomorrow, we just don't know when it will be. I'm still trying make plans where possible, even if they're vague and doing what I can to be in a good place when we come out of this.
