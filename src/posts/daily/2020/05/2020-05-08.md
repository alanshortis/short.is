To get a new development job it's now common to undergo a technical test. These tests are often unrelated to any real-world scenarios that you might come across while building a website or app and more likely brainteasers, algorithms or data structures.

I don't know very much about these at all, and would no doubt fail a test, so I have started a small GitHub repo of common problems that I'll try and solve, presented in a way that is useable for anyone else who stumbles upon the repository.

As of now, [js-problems](https://github.com/alanshortis/js-problems) has only a couple of simple examples to get me started, but I have set up a test runner and a structure so that as I learn more of these problems I can add them to the repo. The hope is, I'll get better at thinking in JS than I currently do, or don't.
