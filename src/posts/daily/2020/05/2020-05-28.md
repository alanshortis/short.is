That ongoing feeling that I want to be learning more about A but it's more beneficial to my employer that I learn B took an interesting turn. May is the month we're required to set goals for the year, against which we'll be judged to assess our performance and it was strongly suggested I set a quite specific goal.

Yesterday I talked about imposter syndrome, and how it had become quite evident recently, and with the prospect of needing to deliver some complex work. What I didn't mention is that there was a message sent out to the wider development team asking if anyone has expertise in working SVG. No one did.

Skip forward to today. The lead front end developer for my team agreed that a good goal for me would be to become the go-to person when it comes to SVG and data visualisation. I really need that to happen and with it being officially set as my primary goal for the year I should be given time and resource to do it.

I feel as if this could lead to a new chapter in my career. A specialism that could well be in quite high demand. I'm ready for it.
