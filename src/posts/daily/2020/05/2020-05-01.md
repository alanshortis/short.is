There is a point where your own political beliefs stray from those of your parents. I think that point was passed some time ago in my case, but recently it's come into sharp focus.

Both my mother and father are Daily Mail readers. That horrific, hate filled rag no doubt influences some of their beliefs. Their defense of the government recently has been really hard to swallow.

They continue to think that they're doing a good job, defending things like counting a pair of gloves as two pieces of PPE, or not including care home deaths in the official statistics. They were both all over Italy when their deaths spiked, trying to claim it was cultural or down to an older population, yet when the UKs figures reached those high it's no big deal or overblown.

There is a strange arrogance in older people from the UK. As if they personally fought in the second world war, or had a hand in the empire.

It's often said that as you get older, you get more conservative. I think what actually happens is that people have more money as they age, and conservative policies become more appealing. It's ot age, it's wealth.

The more I pay attention, the further left I move.
