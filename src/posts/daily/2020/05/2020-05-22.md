Talking about my racing-bikes-for-a-while-phase reminded me of another phase that I, and many other people, had. Photography.

I loved my Holga. A cheap, plastic medium format camera whose charm was in it being such poor quality that the photos would have refractions and unpredictable blur from the terrible lens, and light leaks from the body that barely fitted together properly. I liked that aesthetic, but wanted something cleaner.

Sticking to medium format, I got myself a Bronica. I bought it in New York, and the same afternoon I took probably the best photos I've ever captured; that real Stephen Shore style of clean Americana. Or so I thought.

Parallel to this I had a Nikon D70 which by modern standards is now just a paper weight. 6 megapixels. But the Sigma 10mm ultra-wide lens (without any fisheye) made everything look huge and cinematic, and I loved it.

For reasons I don't need to get into here, I had to ultimately sell everything to pay bills. And, like most things, I grew tired of chasing an idea in my head but not finding it.

Is this is a recurring theme? Attempted hobbies that lead to nothing? Or evolve into something more convenient and kind of close to the thing but but quite the thing I actually loved? My instagram, populated entirely with iPhone snaps, may answer this question for me.
