Attempting to date during a lockdown is ridiculous, but boredom is a hell of a thing and it led me to swiping some faces away on Tinder. It took just a few days to get fed up with it. It's largely the same routine with maybe 30% of people: 'Not your average girl', 'My kids are my world' or even lengthy profiles berating people in advance for not being interesting or acomplished enough.

Against the odds, I got talking to someone who seems almost too good to be true.
