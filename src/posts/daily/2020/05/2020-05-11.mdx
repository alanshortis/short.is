It's end-of-year-review season at work, and that means disappointment and confusion about the ratings given.

We have a rating of 1-5, with 1 being 'fucking terrible' and 5 being 'fucking awesome'. I got a 3, right down the middle, and I'm fine with it. I may have done additional work in my own time to get our design system up and running, and I may have spent a good amount of time travelling to London to support that, but... I also made the really smart move to tell my boss just how much I hate my career. So I guess that all evens out.

Something I'm trying to make other people aware of, is that someone else's rating is not a reflection on your performance. It might be hard to understand why someone got a better rating, but really it has nothing to do with you. Bad rating? try and improve it. Ignore others.
