I'm now more than 13 years as a _professional_ developer and my imposter syndrome is no less severe. After a 4 hour planning meeting today it was decided that I would consult for another team who are creating a new component that features some SVG animation.

I would love to put on some headphones and get my teeth into a problem like that, but the idea of pairing with another developer who I don't know well is terrifying. Having my process of cobbling a solution together then gradually refining it exposed to someone who likely knows what they're doing is my worst nightmare.

If I step back and look at it logically, there is obviously a reason I was put in this position. Developers work in the way I just described pretty often. And with many years of experience behind me I can likely do the work just as well as the next person.

But... Try and tell me that in the moment and I won't ever believe you.
