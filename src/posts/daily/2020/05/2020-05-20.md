Being out on the bike regularly over the last few weeks means I have got used the roads being quieter. What little traffic there has been hasn't been great - a lot of people speeding, people on the phone, close passes - but nothing too bad. No worse than usual.

The last two days, it's almost felt as if the lockdown is over in many people's minds. The road were busy, and one incident in particular left me pretty shaken.

I had no cars ahead or behind me. In the opposite direction, a couple of slower moving vans. They were clearly too slow for someone in a Caterham who chose to overtake. He was on my side of the road, coming directly at me at well over 100mph. I had to ride onto the verge to avoid being hit.

I wonder if he had any idea what he did? I wonder if he even cared?
