The people who are largely responsible for pushing too much JavaScript into browsers have now caught on to the fact that performance is important, and in doing say are now saying that we should be putting more on the server.

The sheer arrogance is remarkable. People love to diss PHP, but having operations run on the server and lightweight HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for interactivity in the browser is what it's been doing very well for a very long time. These people think they just invented it.

Today at work, another developer was struggling to implement a carousel. Setting aside the fact that a carousel is not something we should even be adding now, the many React based libraries come with a large amount of bloat, dependencies and opinions. In the end, the approach was to forget JavaScript. Stop thinking more JavaScript is the solution.

[Using CSS](https://codepen.io/alanshortis/pen/XWmYyjO), it's entirely possible to make a simple, good-enough carousel with smooth, snapped scrolling. The [support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-snappoints) is much better than you'd expect, and it had the added bonus of blowing the minds of the JS faithful who have stopped paying attention to what CSS can do, all on its own.
