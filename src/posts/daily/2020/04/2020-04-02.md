The cycling event I had entered for July (Marmotte Alpes) has been moved to September to account for COVID restrictions. While I think early September is optimistic for this all being over, it does mean that I once again have something to train for. And I need that goal to motivate me, though sometimes even that doesn't work.

22 weeks is enough time to totally transform oneself physically, with the added bonus of that training now being able to take place in spring and summer, even if the majority of it will need to be solo.

Alright. I may regret this, but lets set some goals:

- PR on the Galibier.
- PR on Alpe d'Huez.

Shit.
