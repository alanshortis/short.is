What actually defines seniority in a developer role? Is it a pure measure of ability? Does experience transcend deep knowledge of a particular language?

There are certainly people that have 'senior' in their job title purely because of longevity or deep domain knowledge of a proprietary system or processes specific to a company. That's still valid, but only within their company.

Seniority is relative to the place of employment. I've been senior, and I deserved it _in that company_. Now I'm in a different company, in a different industry, with its own processes, tech stack and co-workers I'm not so sure I'd be a good fit for a senior role should one become available.
