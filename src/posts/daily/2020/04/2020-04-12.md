Everyone has Netflix, or they at least log in with someone else's details. A lot of people have Amazon Prime, but probably more for the free shipping than the quality of the TV shows available (who ever came up with that structure for Prime is a genius).

Where does AppleTV fit into this? Even as an Apple fan, I can't say that I would make space for this subscription over another. This was solved for me though as included in the price of a new apple device was a full year.

This is longwinded preamble for what led me to be watching Little America - each episode is a standalone story of an immigrant in the USA, and it's absolutely phenomenal. Beyond the stories themselves, the production quality is beyond anything I have seen on Netflix. The colour, contrast, detail, light...

If you have AppleTV, don't sleep on this series. It's worth your time in what is an extremely crowded market.
