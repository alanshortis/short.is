Every time I have built a website for myself I have designed in the browser. That works for the most part as it's not necessary for anyone else to be involved, it eliminates a step, and verifies that what I am thinking will work in the desired context.

I'm not doing that this time. I've been working on designing the refresh of this site in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and doing my best not to think about the 'how' when it comes to development, and rather design exactly what I want to see. I'll figure out how to make it happen later.

Building components in Figma and trying to mirror those in React should also make composing new pages or adjusting existing ones pretty seamless.

It's not likely this will be a true design system, but more a set of designs that can be easily maintained and worked with.
