In the film Limitless one of the first things Eddie does after taking the mid expanding drug is clean and tidy his apartment. I get that. Having mess isn't only something that no one really wants, it's also the number one excuse or reason not to be being productive.

With needing to be at home, the mess has built up almost by accident over the last week, and admittedly there are still one or two boxes from when I moved whose content hasn't yet found a proper home. So I did that today. And nothing else.

Maybe I should have trained, practiced some coding problems or read but now that I've managed to deal with the house that's one less thing to get in the way.
