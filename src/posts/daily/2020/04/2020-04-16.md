It's not a great surprise that a lot of the tasks coming up in the day job are focussed on easing the strain on call centre staff. Unfortunately this has led to some work that is labelled as incredibly urgent.

When everything is urgent, nothing is. The futility of it all becomes more exaggerated when the business sleeps on requirements, then suggests developers work the weekend to make up the time.

It's difficult. Things that are going to benefit the business during this crisis really need to be delivered quickly. But at the same time, the blurred line between work and not-work when we're now all learning to do this 100% remotely is an issue even before the expectation of weekend work is introduced.

If my manager requests weekend work, clarifies how that time will be repaid and make it clear that this is not the new normal, I'd be open to it. In this case, it was someone outside the development team making an assumption then trying to use the 'team player' guise. No. I don't think so.
