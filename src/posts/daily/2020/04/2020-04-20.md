It's really easy to get worked up and irritated when work requirements are shifting in real time, literally while the feature is being worked on. Having business people ask 'how hard can it be' while trying to make sense of ambiguous requests and new problems is understandably infuriating.

This is what I was up against today, and yet somehow I managed to remain mostly calm, thinking issues through and making sure to do the right thing, not the thing that just got me to the end.

It made the rest of the day so much better by not being a ball of stress.
