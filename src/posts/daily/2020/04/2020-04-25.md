I usually think about what I might want to write while I'm doing something that doesn't need much thinking. Today, it was while cycling and I thought I was going to write about my apathy with messages and the various platforms they arrive on.

But, today has actually turned out to be the loneliest yet. It's around 6 weeks since I saw anyone (as I was working from home and distancing before it became law) and in that time I have found myself a little overloaded with messages to respond to, or my phone will chime a few times in a row and I'd actually be irritated.

Today, no one really instigated conversation and I couldn't think of anyone to reach out to myself. There were people I'd like to talk to, but I also promised myself that I wouldn't chase people.

I think everyone has a hierarchy of people they want to be talking to. You may get a message from someone once they've exhausted people higher on the list. You'll reply but in the meantime someone else also replied, so you end up not having their attention once again.
