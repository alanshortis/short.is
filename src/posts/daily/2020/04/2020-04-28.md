Trump's recent behaviour (which I wrote about in #39) has sparked a lot of people joking about drinking disinfectant. Or posting 'funny' gifs of Trump, or Kim Jong-un, or Boris Johnson.

I'm past the point of finding any of it funny. I cannot laugh at any of this anymore. Trumps actions before he was even president (demanding Obama's birth certificate, for example) should have been enough to exclude him from any position of power, authority or respect.

Also today, Billionaire Alan Sugar has endorsed a message that suggest the press should only print positive news, and should stop holding the government to account for their clear failings.

This is just one of a few things that really concerns me for the future. Press no longer being free, NHS no longer existing, and the very real possibility that Trump cancels the November election. Who would stop him?
