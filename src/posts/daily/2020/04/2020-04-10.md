As a developer, it too often feels like I have so much more to learn than I can possibly fit into the time available.

To get ahead I should probably be focussing on Typescript and GraphQL. These technologies are a big deal, and having them would make me more hireable. But what I really like, and what got me into this weird profession in the first place, is creating beautiful things. It all started with being a design hobbyist who realised that the web was a good way to show off work.

Around 18 months ago I moved to a company that works in React and JavaScript and is far less focussed on CSS and design. As a result, my CSS skills are slipping, my deep knowledge of SVG is lacking, and I'm enjoying the role less than ever.

Could a portfolio full of CSS and SVG experiments and a really good looking website be enough to keep me attractive to employers? It's not going to help me in a pure JS interview or technical test, but perhaps there actually are roles out there for people who want to make data visualisations and complex styling?

The real answer is: **Do what you love.** If I keep trying to learn Typescript and JavaScript algorithms I'm going to keep losing the love for what I do. If I focus on making things I can be proud of, the passion will return and I'll end up with the stomach to learn those things anyway.
