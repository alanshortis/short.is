I heard a few people talking about losing track of the days. And while the weekend has less meaning now, it's still fairly easy for me to tell the difference. It's not just a 48 hour relief from video calls.

More, I am noticing a total shift in my perception of time. Today I was out on the bike for a little under 3 hours and yet somehow it dominated my entire day. Conversely, a week day has me at my desk for 8 hours, but that time when work is over feels like ages.

The constant drone on twitter of people telling you that you _must_ use this time to learn, build a business, advance your career etc etc etc is infuriating. Once the daily chores, exercise, and cooking are all out of the way there are very few clear hours left to make things happen. Or maybe, I just don't want to spend more time at a computer after a full day of work.
