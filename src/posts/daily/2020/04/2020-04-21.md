Talking to a friend about music this evening, we moved between Jazz sub-genres, trying to choose the best ever underground hip-hop album, MF DOOM, and the fact that most men have Tool and Godspeed You! Black Emperor phases. I suggested that you could add Zappa to that phenomenon but she countered that she knows more women into Zappa than men.

It's so rare that I talk to people about music in this way, but it's one of my favorite things to do. I've been directly and indirectly labelled a music snob before, but I don't see i that way; it's the difference between seeing music purely as entertainment or background noise, and seeing music as art. That's all. And in art, authenticity matters.
