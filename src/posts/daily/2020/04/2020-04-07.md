Funny how being lonely can alter your idea of a good idea vs a bad one. I've come very close to messaging en ex today, mostly because I'd like to know if she's doing ok in this situation, but also in the hope that we'll strike up some conversation.

Logical brain knows this is a terrible idea. Logical brain can accurately predict the outcome nine times out of 10. Illogical, lonely brain cannot do this.

Thinking about things before being compulsive isn't always easy but there are times when it's essential to avoid disaster, the opening of old wounds, and feeling like a fucking idiot when the logic brain takes the reins again.
