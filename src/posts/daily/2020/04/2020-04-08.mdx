I have a feeling I'm going to find true motivation when I see some results. But in order to see some results I'm going to need some motivation.

I think a period of strict [pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is the way to go for a while. Once you get into the rhythm of it, it's pretty amazing just how much can get done in a 25 minute work period. More, it's incredible just how short a 5 minute break can feel.
