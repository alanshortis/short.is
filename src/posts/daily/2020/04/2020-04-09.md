I have to keep reminding myself that this isn't really 'working from home', it's actually forced isolation because of a global pandemic. There is a definite distinction there.

I have wanted a 100% remote job for a while now, but I wanted it because of the freedom it'd give me. I don't really want to remain in Nottingham, but Nottingham is where my career started to take some direction (despite how I may feel about my it right now). A remote position would mean I could find my place without needing to make that difficult jump between jobs and a home all at once.

This isn't really 'working from home', but it is perhaps a glimpse at what I thought I wanted but with that freedom removed. It's like having the worst aspects of an office based job and a home one, all at once. Constrained by location, trapped by isolation.
