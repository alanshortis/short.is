I'm in the 'looking online for hours' phase of designing this new website. I know the aspects of the existing design that I want to retain, but I also really want to push it up a level. Find the little details to make it better, more impressive and something I can be proud of.

Like anything, designing takes practice. It's weird to think that the more time you spend trying to have ideas the more ideas you will inevitably have. Speaking for myself, 9 out of 10 of my design ideas are nonsense, or derivative. Which is fine; I'm not a designer.
