I started strong this morning, stretching and making a list for the day and the week. I worked fairly well. I cycled. I made healthy if slightly bland meals. I got to bed at a good time, ready to rest. It was only once I was in bed that I remembered that I hadn't written, and I hadn't done at least one lesson in Duolingo.

I have pretty strong streaks for each of these - 21 days for writing, 14 for learning German. Had I not had that kind of record behind me I might have rolled over and gone to sleep.

If I'd broken the streak, by the time I was back where I was I could have been on day 44 and 28.

Failing to do something on one day is something, but when that failure ripples out it makes it much harder to swallow. A streak is a powerful thing.
