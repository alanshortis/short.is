Not only is Red Dead Redemption 2 beautiful and incredible, it also provides opportunities for some quarantine style creativity. In photo mode, the game is paused and you can freely move the camera around the scene (within some limits). You can change zoom, lenses, focus, exposure and are provided with some filters (though many of these filters are for in-game effects like drunkenness and for cut scenes and title cards).

There are more than enough possibilities to create some truly one-off images. This is not just screen-caps of game play.

I posted a few from the first chapter to [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-mb2vcFCnq/). Try it out if you can; it adds a huge new dimension to the game.
