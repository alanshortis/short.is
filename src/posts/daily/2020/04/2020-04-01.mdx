I never much liked April fools, and it's not because I'm anti-fun or anything like that. It's common for pranks to either be kind of nasty - getting at a laugh at someone's expense - or in the case of fake news stories, much too easy to spot.

The isolation has got to me a little today. By all accounts, we're nowhere near the peak of this thing and considering this is only week 3 and a minimum it's 9 more weeks lie ahead I'm worried I won't cope.

I'm really pleased to have seen no April fools jokes at all today. I'm not sure I could have taken it in good humour.
