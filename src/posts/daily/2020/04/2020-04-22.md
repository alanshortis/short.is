I sometimes wonder if I enjoy building and maintaining bikes more than I enjoy riding them. While I didn't do everything I planned to today (I haven't yet finished the best bike, though it just needs a chain and bar tape) I did finally clean the fixed gear bike, and fit a different seatpost.

My fixie is a stupid bike. I picked up the frame in a Dolan clearance sale for £90. The parts are either those that I had lying around, or the cheapest Deda parts (£12 handlebars). But this _economy_ build falls down a little as one of the parts I had 'lying around' was a pair on ENVE 1.0 road forks. Forgetting retail cost, the used value of these forks probably outweighs the rest of the parts combined.

I'll get the best bike (Ridley Helium SL, Campagnolo Super Record) finished during the day tomorrow and take a fairly short shakedown ride tomorrow if all goes to plan.
