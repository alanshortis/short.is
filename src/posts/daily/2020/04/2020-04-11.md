Major cycling mistake today: I set off to ride without eating (deliberately) but also didn't take any food with me (mistakenly). I have been planning my rides recently so there are multiple ways back, giving me the option to cut the distance and to avoid ever being too far from home.

I had an idea of the route I wanted to take home, but I was enjoying being out and kept pushing on beyond a few points to turn back. That is, until I was at the furthest possible point and went for my pocket for some food that wasn't there.

End result, getting home after 53 miles having had only 500ml of water.

Don't do that. It's not nice.
