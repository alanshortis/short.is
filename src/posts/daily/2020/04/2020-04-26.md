It's common among cyclists to use the average speed of a ride as a mark of quality. They want people to check strava and see that they nailed a 20mph average speed (20 seems to be some unoffical threshold), so they must be going well.

It's very often nonsense. You can get that average to appear on strava while sitting in a group and never taking a turn. You could have a monstrous tailwind. On a Garmin device, you can choose at which speed the ride will automatically pause; I have known people to set this as high a 4mph so they can roll towards traffic lights while recording a speed of zero, so as not to harm the average.

Most people have been guilty of this, even those that will proclaim the pursuit of a high average to a nonsense before embarking on a ride where it seemed to matter. That was me today. I don't know exactly why, but I set off for a ride and really wanted to hit a specific average.

I was 0.9mph off plan, but with the headwind I'm happy with it.

Oh, I forgot to mention the litany of excuses that comes when justifying an average speed. That's also a thing.
