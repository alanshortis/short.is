I played drums for around 10 years, from 1994 when I gave it a try in a school music lesson and nailed it, through a couple of bands, until the band I was in ended and it become impossible to keep it up. Drums are loud, expensive and hard to move and I was living in small flats with no transport.

I've been thinking of getting a practice pad or a small electric kit for a while, but today I made a move that makes that less of an option. I bought a bass.

A Fender (well, Squier) Jazz Bass.

I've always loved good bassists, always listened to good players closely, and now I'm going to find out if that enjoyment of bass extends to any kind of aptitude for it. The fact that I haven't played anything melodic for an eternity is going to make the theory difficult, but I _think_ I have a good ear, and I am definitely better at listening than I used to be.

The biggest challenge will be learning to walk before I can run.
