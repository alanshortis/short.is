Mondays are rough, especially following such a good weekend of cycling and resting. Toady was severely affected by procrastination. It took me a very long time to get into any kind of flow, and I eventually used [forest](https://www.forestapp.cc/) to help stop me touching my phone.

I wasn't even putting off a difficult task, it was reasonably simple to solve (as simple a monorepos can be) but I just kept putting it off. I didn't want to do it.

When I finally got going, I finished what needed to be done quickly and felt immediate relief. All of that self inflicted worry and panic by simply not doing what needs to be done, and for what? I couldn't tell you right now why I act this way.

Perhaps tomorrow I'll realise I could end my work day feeling satisfied and relaxed if I'd just fucking get on with it.
