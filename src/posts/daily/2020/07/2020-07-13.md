Another TV subscription is the last thing I need, but despite not being into Disney movies, Marvel, or Star Wars at all, I'm all in on Disney+ for a while.

Something else I'm not into is musical theatre, but Hamilton was my initial reason for signing up. It's pretty amazing, even if I kind of enjoyed it on a technical level more than anything. I cannot fathom how the choreography would have been planned or documentated in a way that can be reproduced and refined.

I'm about 20 episodes into the Simpsons. I'd only seen a handful of episodes before, and most of them from a very worn VHS tape, lent to me by a school friend who recorded them from Sky in the mid 90s.
