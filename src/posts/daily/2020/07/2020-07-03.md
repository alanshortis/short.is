Work hours are weird. They mandate that you work between one time and another, and if your work is even slightly creative it quickly becomes clear that this doesn't really work. Creativity, the right frame of mind to work, and ideas just don't work on a schedule.

This evening I made a reasonably large amendment to some work I'd done during the day. The change came to me while I was in the shower and not thinking about anything in particular. This ideas-in-the-bathroom thing isn't new; my Dad was an engineer for Ford for many years, and in that time he desgiend speedometers (where he used fireoptics very early) and fuel pumps. He won the Henry Ford Technology Award and earned various patents for an idea he had while in the bathroom.

I'm growing more and more fond of the idea of working for myself somehow, being able to truly choose my work hours and getting things working when inspiration strikes. Not having to stop for meetings and admin. Trying to make the work I do have some meaning and satisfaction.
