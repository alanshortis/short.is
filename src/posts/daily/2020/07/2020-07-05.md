After not really thinking about them for years, I have been scanning and organising my negatives. They're mostly 120 roll film with a little 35mm, and the majority wre shot between 2007 and 2010 using a Holga.

Holga cameras are cheap, with platic lenses and leaky plastic bodies, but the look you get from the final photo was almost certainly the direct influence for the early days of Instagram. Square images with questionable colour, light leaks, distortion and unpredictable focus. This is not a camera for those who are looking for high quality images.

My love for the Hogla eventually grew a little thinner and I found a Bronica EC TL in a Brooklyn camera exchange. I used it immediately and got some of my better photos.

I had to sell nearly all my cameras in order to pay bills some years ago, but I kept both of my Holgas (one I modified to get more light leaks, the other is a little cleaner but has a bulb setting for guessed long exposures). It might be about time I tried again.
