For a while I would clip a microphone to the outside of my bag and record the city I was in. There is a clear difference in how the London Undergound sounds compared to the New York Metro. Different again is the Subway in Toronto, or a tram in Nottingham.

When lived in Hackney Wick I would take a very early Overground trains. Occasionally a freight train would pass through the station while I was waiting. Unlike passenger trains, they sound very slow and deliberate. Trundling through, the huge weight causing a much deeper sound through the tracks and the ground below.
