When Radiohead released Kid A it was almost a rebellion against what they'd done with OK Computer. They took a left turn, and introduced more electronic and dance influeced sounds.

It wasn't new. On Dark Side of the Moon, Pink Floyd included On The Run which was made almost entirely using synths with other sounds added over the top. There wasn't sampling in the early 70s but that's essentially what they were doing. The technology of the time meant that tapes would need to be looped around mic stands to time them and the whole band would be the the desk to piece the whole track together. It was a performance in itself.

On Wish You Were Here they took it up a notch, using the synth and sampling on a more 'real' song, paired with vocals and acoustic guitar. It still sounds futuristic 45 years later, and it could be argued that it was a more practical application of the technology than On The Run. Less of a technical exercise.
