My memory is absolutely shot to bits. I had an idea of what I was going to write about while in the kitchen, and in the time it took for me to walk from there to the sofa to write, it was gone.

I live in a small house.

It's not limited to this. Every day I open a new browser tab to look something up and immediately forget what it was. I may need to change something in code and I'll read what's currently there, wonder why anyone would do that, check who did and it was me. Recently.
