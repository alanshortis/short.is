When asked to present some recent work to the whole department, I initially wondered why. It's going to take me literally one minute to cover the changes that have been made. But. The changes pave the way for a major new feature, and it's the first change to go into production that uses the new design system and pattern library that I started work on in _Obtober_.

I rarely feel proud of my work, but I think I'm going to allow it this time.
