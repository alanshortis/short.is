Virtual cycling has been pretty popular the last couple of years, but since lockdown started it has absolutely exploded. There is no denying that a properly focussed session on a turbo trainer can far exceed the effectiveness of some aimless outdoor riding; I have been using [TrainerRoad](https://www.trainerroad.com/) the last few weeks, with some time on [RGT](https://www.rgtcycling.com/) too (I can confirm that Ventoux is miserable on a Turbo Trainer too).

The thing I struggle a little with is Zwift. Invented virtual worlds to break boredom is one thing, but the current _Virtual Tour de France_ is another. I find it baffling that this kind of virtual racing is as popular as it is. Some recent YouTube videos have shown the likes of Alex Dowsett being beaten by nobodies on time trials, and this is almost certainly because of ambituous weight and FTP combinations being used. It's no better than doping. Hollow victory.

I really can't wait to see some real racing soon. F1 is back this week, and the measures being taken are very through reletively easy to control as races can take place behind closed doors. Cycling takes place on public roads with crowds getting extremelt close to the riders; proper distnacing and ensuring the safety of everyone invloved is going to be impossible.
