I've been a fringe Formula 1 fan for a long time, paying enough attention to know who's good, who's dominant, and watching races if I happen to be looking for something to watch.

My interest has grown over the last few years, but the 2020 season has been much more captivaing to me than any other. I paid attention during the off-season to car and team developments and the unorthadox season due to COVID has made for increased anticipation.

The first two rounds taking place at the same circuit sounds like it should have made for dull racing, but each one had enough drama and unpredictability to made it engaging through lengthy qualifying sessions and races.

It's unfortunate that the fans (those who are active online at least) seem to be pretty toxic. So, so many comments under Facebook posts about the racing being boring, Hamilton not being very good (as if SIX would titles and a host of other records were a fluke), and more worryingly, a lot of people pushing back on F1s efforts to improve diversity and acknowledge racism. People even calling Hamilton himself a racist.

But that's the internet for you once again; it can ruin anything. If you let it. I'm going to enjoy the shit out of the racing this year and avoid the armchair experts.
