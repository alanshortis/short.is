What if, for one month, I trained by the book. I ensured I rode enough hours per week, used TrainerRoad when the weather is terrible, I stopped riding just to get outside, I ate perfectly and took the right supplements at the right time, and made sure to get plenty of sleep.

A month is long enough to form habits and to see some real results. It'll be unpleasant, but it might be worthwhile to boost my form and make me feel much better about my riding and inspire me to work harder and take things a little more seriously. An added benefit would be being able to ride when with the people I like (when it's allowed) and not feel as if I'm holding them up, which is how it's been for literally years.

Fuck it, lets do it. It's about 5 weeks until I'm in the alps and I'd prefer not to die at the top of a Col this time.
