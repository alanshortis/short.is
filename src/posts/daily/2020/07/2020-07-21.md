After doing the first few monts of lockdown on a cheap plastic chair, I finally bit the bullet and bought something proper.

The Herman Miller Aeron is truly the gold standard of office chairs, but at over Â£1,000 for a new one it's pretty much impossible to justify one for home. I was lucky to find one on eBay at less than half price, and while it's obviously used it's in near-perfect condition.

It's pretty much impossible to slouch on the thing, and sitting upright make a huge difference for productivity.
