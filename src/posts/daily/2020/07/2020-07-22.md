On a large, older codebase there is very rarely 'bad' code. People generally know what they're doing, but are always working within certain constraints and expectations. The longer code is around, the more you need to work around the past decisions which can lead to writing things in a way you might not really like.

It's worth remembering this before dismissing any code or approach as _bad_. It might be bad, but it's more likely just the result of compromises.
