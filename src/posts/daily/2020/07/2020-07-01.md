I'm sure I have touched on this before, but I have deep, real concerns about the future. I don't think it's a reach to say that we're seeing the early stages of the fall of democracy. Huge outside influence in elections, Facebook being used to leverage voters prejudices (and then being totally unrepentant about it), news or opinions that people dislike being dismissed as fake or consipracy, populist politicians who've been invloved in making people's lives absolute shit then convincing them that it's _their_ fault. You know, immigrants and poor people.

For the last couple of years I have been convinced that something very bad would happen in my lifetime. I thought COVID might be it, but I don't think so anymore. I think there will be war within the next 15 years; either as a new Cold War featuring cyber attacks, deep fakes, and misinformation, or a hot war that will invlove nuclear weapons.

All this, combined with the climate emergency, is going to make for a very bleak future for many. I do not feel optimistic today. And I apologise for writing this. But sometimes it needs to come out.
