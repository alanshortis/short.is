Doomscrolling is when you scroll endless through Facebook, Twitter, or other newsfeeds only really paying attention to the bad news.

It's been a feature of most mornings for me recently mostly because good news is fairly hard to come by. That's not to say it's not there, but with so many genuinely horrible things happening there just isn't space.

It's pretty amazing how stoic we've become to all of this. Mass shootings barely make the news, COVID is something we're learning to live with, and somehow US government stooges in unmarked uniforms and vehicles snatching people up with no explanation isn't proviking international outrage.
