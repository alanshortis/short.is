The airport is the one place where people have either no time at all, or plenty of time to kill. Most people either started or will end their day in a different city or country to the next.

I didn't expect to fly at all this year, but I just booked some very cheap travel to Athens. I've never been to Greece. Actually, it'll be the furthest east I have ever travelled. Right now the destination is coming second to being able to spend some time in an Airport. There is no better place to sit and read than a deserted gate, occasionally glancing out at an aircraft being prepped after arriving from... somewhere.
