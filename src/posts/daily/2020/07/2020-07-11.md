Use it or lose it. It applies to a lot of things, but as of right now it's cycling strength, a strong lower back, and pain-free knees.

Lockdown hasn't been great for me. Being hunched over a desk has ruined my posture and a lack of motivation to do _anything_ has made what what little fitness I had fade further.

Today I managed to squeeze out a 77 mile ride with more than 5,000ft of elevation, and if I'd judged it purely on the statistic (average power and elapsed time) it could have been classed as a failure.

With the vast majority of our social interaction taking place online, people naturally put the best version of themselves forward. Yesterday two people I follow on Strava posted rides with new power records, so naturally my immediate reaction is to feel as if I'm somehow failing with my stats being what they are. But that's not how it works. We're not competing; we have our own lives, struggles, and circumstances and mine being what they have led me to my current state.

Also. Honestly - anyone who can ride 77 miles with a good amount of climbing at ANY pace must be doing something right.
