When you get a random day off, you go into it with the best intentions making plans to get up at a particular time and get a bunch of things done that have been put off for however.

It's 11am before you know it because you found some absolute nonsense on YouTube, got caught up in soime chore that was unplanned but caught your attention, or you just kind of sit around and let the day slip by all the while the todo list becomes a work of fiction. If it wasn't already.
