There is an unspoken camaraderie between people who have the same type of vehicle. Motorcyclists, bus drivers, and cyclists all have this. If I wave at another cyclist and they dont acknowledge me I actually find it kind of offensive, in an odd way.

There is a little elitism inherent in this. A bus driver might not wave at a someone driving a rival company's bus and a cyclist may not wave at someone just because they're on a bike, and not really _serious looking_ enough.

A friend owns a VW T5 van which he has converted to sleep in, and he always had other owners wave at him on the road. When he chose to put the logo of our cycliing club on the bonnet, other T5 owners assumed he was a tradesman and the waves dried up instantly.
