I always thought that I liked working alone better than in a group, and that's reflected in the work I have been picking up over the last 9 months or so.

Now that project has come to an end, I've been back on an older app that is routinely worked on by 6 or 7 developers and I'm surprised at how much more I'm getting out of it. Getting work approved after working with someone else feels more satisfying in a way.

But. It might not be that at all. Doing work separated from others means that people can sometimes assume you're not contributing. Visibility of your work counts more than the actual work you do. It's a shame I'm not really able to ignore what people say and _know_ that I have done good work.
