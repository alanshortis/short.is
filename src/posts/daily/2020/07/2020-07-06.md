Before platforms like Squarespace were so good and affordable, being someone who can make websites meant you were always in demand from friends to build their ideas. I once designed and built a full ecommerce site for someone, agonised over the details, set up card payments etc and ended up being paid just Â£150 after a long delay.

Those days are over, both in terms of that kind of work being needed and me even considering saying yes to it, but I have done the occasional Google ad over the last couple of years. Today, it was an HTML email. I'd forgtten the sheer pain of putting these together.

It made me realise that right now, the extra free time is vastly more importatnt to me than some extra money, espeacilly when the work isn't simple enough to just do in front of the TV, but not an interesting challenge or learing opportunity.
