There is an assumption that people who program computers are naturally good with mathematics. I'm absolutely useless. A while ago I was given a project that would have required some trigonometry and I was 50% terrified and 50% excited to actually learn it.

I know I learned algebra, long division and some trigonometry at school, but that being more than 20 years ago and I cannot remember any of it.

Do I even need to know it? Wouldn't my time be better spent learning something directly applicable to my work? Or, is learning anything beneficial to learning anything else? Learning o learn?
