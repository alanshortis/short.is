In software development, building to spec is a pretty strong skill. Trying to come up with features to cover potential scenrios that weren't asked for is not a good use of time.

It may seem as if trying to add features makes for added value, but what it actually does is add complexity. Should those extra features be needed later, that's when they should be added, according to the new spec at that time.
