IKEA is generally not a great experience. Being herded around in a set order, being shown some conceptual rooms, screaming children and people unable to stay a safe distance away, and that's all before you try and find what you need in the warehouse which is inevitably not actually where you expected it.

But when it's all picked and paid for, there are Â£1 hotdogs and delicious cinnamon buns ready and waiting. And for that, it's well worth it.
