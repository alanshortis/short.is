There is a task that needs doing. It might be a tricky work task, or it might be a phonecall to someone you've not spoken to for a while. It's not urgent enough to just do, but important enough that it cannot be ignored for long.

That time spent avoiding isn't free from the task. It's there, in the back of your mind, gently ruining your day. If you'd just done it promptly the time afterwards truly is free, and you get some margin for error as a bonus.

What starts as procrastination turns into a cycle of avoiding something you've imagined to be terrible. Like a plaster, it's best just to rip it off quickly.
