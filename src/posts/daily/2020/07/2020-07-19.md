Queuing as an endurance sport. Needing to get some items from IKEA now means joining a lenghty line, spending the duration wondering if it's really worth it. You send one co-queuer off to buy drinks at Subway, which is really nicely located nearby but does mean climing over the make-shift barriers to keep the line organised.

After 30 minutes you look at delivery costs, and while a tenner is a fraction of what you'd pay to leave the hell-line, it's 2 weeks wait. Nah.

Once inside, getting past the showroom is like a slalom and an exercise in finding legal and safe shortcuts. Finally making it to the market hall, all the items committed to memory during the HOUR spent trying to get in are thrown into a trolley and the one item from the warehouse quickly located.

Time for the another queue, to checkout and pay. A mere 10 minutes is _nothing_ these days. Barely noticeable, and there are bags of cinnamon buns stacked high which make the ordeal almost worthwhile in itself.

One hotdog and one broken plant pot later, it's all in the car and being ferried home to clutter the house up a little more.

Houseplant count: 32.

Mains electrocutions from fitting lights: 0.
