An obstacle in daily writing are occasional migraines. The worst ones include vomiting and nose bleeds, and while I'm lucky enough to have avoided that today, I am finding it very hard to look at screens.

It's taken me about 20 minutes to write this. Needing to look away, many typos (and I'm bound to have missed some) and not being trilled about writing about a headache means I should probably stop.
