20 minutes to kill. A little bit of Read Dead Redemption. Controller batteries are dead. Dig in the drawer for a fresh set. Find them, fit them. Turn on the xbox. I still have 15 minutes. Start the game. Oh. Software update. 4.69GB. Can't be bypassed. I guess I'd better do it. It's finally done. With 2 minutes to spare. Which isn't even enough time to load.

Well. I guess that's one less thing that needs doing.
