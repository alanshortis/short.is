Definitelt frowned upson in open plan offices, whatever benefits a mechanical keyboard has is immediately offset by instant hate from those around you.

Being at home, I bought one pretty quickly. When typing for long periods the extra comfort is pretty noticeable, moreso when the alternative is a 2016 MacBook Pro keyboards. The infamously terrible one.

If and when we go back to the office, I'm expecting a chorus of CLACK CLACK CLACK across the floor as we're all unable to go backwards.
