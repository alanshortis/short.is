Most people have gaps in their exposure to films and music. Films especially for me; working in music shops for quite a long time meant that anything _essential_ was pretty much unavoidable. It was on in the store, it was available to listen to (this is before iTunes, let alone streaming services) and there would be someone to shame you into listening to 'What's going on' if you hadn't already.

I have never seen Jaws. I've never seen Alien. Citizen Kane, Blade Runner, 8Â½, Spirited Away, and the less said about Star Wars the better.

Tonight I am watching 2001 to try and close another hole, but this is something I've tried to watch before but failed. Is tonight the night?
