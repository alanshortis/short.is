Some people say that they don't care what other people think of them. A good percentage of those people don't really mean that, but the rest actually do and actually genuinely aren't troubled by the opinions of others.

I get so much of my energy from other people. If someone I am close to is down, I'm down. If they're energetic and up, more than likely I'll be the same. My brain does some impressive gymnastic to convince me that their mood has been caused by something I have done or their opinion of me as a person even when logic and evidence shows that that's not even close to true.

It may sound like a stretch, but this is directly related to the confidence I have in my own work. If I need to work closely with someone, I'm forever second guessing myself to avoid looking like I don't know what I'm doing. And the mood of the person I am working with might intensify that feeling.

It's exhausting.
