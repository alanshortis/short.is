Modern American music (and, by extension pretty much all popular music) is directly influenced by African American music. Blues, Jazz, Gospel are all genres directly linked to slavey and oppression.

Later, Hip Hop came from the poorest areas of New York City. What emerged was free expression in four elements: DJing, MCing graffiti, and breakdancing. Some add a fifth element of Knowledge.

I strongly the book [Can't Stop Won't Stop](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cant-Stop-Wont-History-Generation-ebook/dp/B004WOE6SM/ref=sr_1_2) by Jeff Chang for a very in depth journey through the origins. There are also a few films that are essential for anyone into music:

- [Wild Style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaXMfw0IJOo) is fiction, and some of the acting is pretty far from good, but it features footage of early shows that is really accurate.
- [Style Wars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4jniA9QsNI) is very different to Wild Style. It's a slick, cinematic documentary that goes deep into the culture in New York City in the early 80s. Primarily focussed on graffiti, it
- [Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEKRAn-ZleM) is a very detailed look at DJing, or more accurately, Turntablism. The section on sampling is an insight into just how complex an art form it really is.
