Ideas are pretty cheap. That's not to say good ideas are easy to come by, but I've lost count of the number of times someone has told they have have a good idea for an app (and we should go 50/50, then get rich) or the number of side projcts I have started and abandoned.

Delivering is what's actually impressive. You could have a hundred genuinely great ideas but if you can't convert them into a deliverable, who cares?

Forget ideas. Focus on delivering.
