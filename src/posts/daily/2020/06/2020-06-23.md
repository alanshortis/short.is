'The First 100 Days' is always the time period chosen by presidential candidates for their most pressing changes and policies. Often undoing something the previous president had implemented.

100 consecutive days of writing is beyond what I expected. It's been hard to think of things to say at times, but the habit is well and truly formed even if I've written at 23:45 once or twice, just managing to keep the streak.

I hope to get to 200, 300 and 400. I hope to be able to keep them (or maybe _make_ them) interesting and relevant and not a document of the day. The jury might be out on that so far; I never read them after posting so there is likely some repetition, but I think this might be more about the process and the discipline than the actual content.
