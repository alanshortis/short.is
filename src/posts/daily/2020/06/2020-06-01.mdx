I've really had to check myself today.

It's not enough to just be _not racist_ right now. I need to act more, be actively anti-racist. Listen more than I speak, try and understand the plight of those with less privilege than I have (and given that I'm a 30-something, middle class white male with a job and good health, that's a huge amount of people), challenge friends and family when they make a joke, comment, or share an opinion that isn't acceptable. It's too easy to let it go.

I made a thoughtless comment myself yesterday, in relation to someone's appearance. Not thinking about the words I was using, not thinking about how what I said was taken, not even really thinking about what I was trying to say. Right now I truly don't know why I said what I did, but they made the point that it came from somewhere. It wasn't just an accident. Having your words played back after the fact can be uncomfortable but being on the receiving end is exponentially worse.

The unconscious discrimination and thoughtlessness that exists in a lot of us is really deep and hard to see, but I really need to work harder to address it. So often people like me pride themselves on being 'good' when we've never really done anything to earn that label. Being silent isn't being good. Failing to acknowledge and learn from your own mistakes and glimpses into your unconscious isn't either.
