Modern American music (and, by extension pretty much all popular music) is directly influenced by African American music. Blues, Jazz, Gospel are all genres directly linked to slavey and oppression.

Later, Hip Hop came from the poorest areas of New York City. What emerged was free expression in four elements: DJing, MCing graffiti, and breakdancing. Some add a fifth element of Knowledge.

I strongly recommend the book [Can't Stop Won't Stop](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cant-Stop-Wont-History-Generation-ebook/dp/B004WOE6SM/ref=sr_1_2) by Jeff Chang for a very in depth journey through the origins. There are also a few films that are essential for anyone into music:

- [Wild Style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaXMfw0IJOo) is fiction, and some of the acting is pretty far from good, but it features footage of early shows that is really accurate. You'll almost certainly recognise some of the dialog as it has been sampled in a lot of music.
- [Style Wars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4jniA9QsNI) is very different to Wild Style. It's a slick, cinematic documentary that goes deep into the culture in New York City in the early 80s.
- [Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEKRAn-ZleM) is a very detailed look at DJing, or more accurately, Turntablism.

So much of this feeds into my love of New York. Perhaps that's a little clich√©d, but being able to visit the place where it all started has some significance. If I could go back to any time and place, it would be New York City in the late 70s.
