I keep making the mistake of reading twitter.

I joined in 2009, and back then it was like a giant, central comments section. Reading it during the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony was pure joy, with people sharing observations and stories and collectively losing their shit when the NHS was honoured so publically. It felt amazing.

Around 2015 I made an effort to shift my follows to people who work in Web development after I attended a couple of conferences and started to take my career seriously. I learned a lot, and I found a Slack community of which I am still actively invloved leading to meeting some amazing people.

From 2016 to now, things have gradually changed. The people I was folowing grew steadily more political and that's not a surprise at all. Trump is an absolute diaster for many under represented and marginalised people; people who happen to be amazing, vocal, and visible in my industry.

I may have hot a limit though. I see so many tweets from racists, from the wilfully ignorant, the misguided, and bots.

Give otherwise decent people a platform on which they can share their thoughts without consequence and you'll quickly see how disgusting they can be.
