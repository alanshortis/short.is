There will always come a time when you need to recognise that you're probably not doing a great job. Either in work, or some personal project or other part of life.

- Recognising this is the hardest part. Making changes to mitigate is much easier once you know it need to happen.
- Give youself a break. You cannot be _on_ all the time. Bad days, weeks, and even months happen.

I can't say with all honesty that I've done my best work recently, but I am trying. More pressure is not what I need right now; I need to take a step back and recognise what good I have done. Then aim for that again.
