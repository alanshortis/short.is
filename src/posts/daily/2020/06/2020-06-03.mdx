The 80/20 rule states that 80% of the time spent building something will result in just 20% of the final product. This has been hugely evident in the work I have been doing recently, with the bulk of my todo list being a compartive breeze compared to thr last few points.

Front end development becomes more and more fullstack as technology evolves, and this means that paradigms like authentication that a back-end developer will have worked with and implemented many times are often new and scary and complex for the implementer.

That's exactly what got me into this 80/20 situation this week.
