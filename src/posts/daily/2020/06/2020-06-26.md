There is a difficult balance when renting. You want to keep the place in good condition or even make some improvements so it's a nice place to live, but not _too_ much so as not to put cash into something you don't own and ultimately add value for your landlord (whose mortgage you're already paying). I have improved a place in the past and as a result the landlord actually increased the rent.

I'm in my late 30s and for many it's pretty late to still not be a homeowner. With lenders needing a good number of years of earning ahead, after 40 things get difficult. But I also cannot easily save enough for a deposit large enough to not have a pretty huge monthly payment.

Owning a house also ties you to a location. I live alone in a part of the country I don't particularly want to be in, but I also have no idea where I would go. I suppose I wouldn't have to live in it, but then I end up right back in the same difficult balance with a landlord.
