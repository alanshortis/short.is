I used to think AJ was the worst character in The Sopranos but he doesn't close to the horror that is Meadow. She may perform well in school and have more academic _smarts_ than AJ, but she is incredibly entitled from start to finish. Spoilt, bratty, put out by everything and everyone, so above it all.

Every times she says 'hellooo' in that patronising tone I wish she'd never been included in the series. She brings roughly nothing to the show (with the episode 'College' being an exception, but even then she only serves as a reason for Tony to be in New England), something that AJ actually does quite regularly.

Even her boyfriends have more relevance in the series. Jacky is a character in his own right, but Noah and Finn are literally just her boyfriends yet they both drive aspects of the story: Tony's racism, and the outing of Vito.

The only redeeming aspect of her character is the gradual move from knowing about her father's business, being angry and attempting to reject it after Jacky, then defending their practices and to 'outsiders' as she gets older.
