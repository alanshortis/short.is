Users ultimately doesn't care about technology choices as long as they don't have any impact on user experience. For things like a database or hosting provider, user experience may come into play for speed and security, and this should trump any real of perceived developer experience.

I have definitely spent long periods of time tinkering with whichever library is the flavour of the week, or learning some new abstraction of an abstraction that may or may not save me X minutes over Y hours of development. All it's really done is divide my attention and stopped me delivering.

For some time I have had a half-started idea for a large scale side project. The idea is to document all the cycling climbs I have done with a focus on those that are less known. The Maurienne Valley in the Alps is the starting point for many iconic climbs used in the Tour de France including the Galibier. Alongside these monuments are some incredible climbs that you've probably never heard of, but they're every bit as challenging and quieter than the legends.

The name - [http://nivolet.cc](nivolet) - comes from an Italian pass that I've never actually ridden, but it represents everything I love in a climb. Long, high, secluded, beautiful and unforgiving.
