At least once in your life you're going to meet someone who takes yours or other people's success or achievements as a personal affront to them. They'll pick holes in things, look for reasons to diminish the achievement, and try and make it appear that they could have done as well _or better_ if they'd been in that position.

Someone doing something well and being commended for it is not a reflection you. It's easy to judge when you only see the end result. The final product doesn't contain the wrong turns, mistakes, misunderstandings, and stress that went into it.
