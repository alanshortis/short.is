I hate/love learning new things. Getting through the phase of having no idea what to do is the worst part of the whole process, but being that I'm a totally self taught developer I've got through that phase many times. But I still hate it. I'm still sure I won't figure out the latest problem in front of me.

When it all comes together, I manage to get things working, and those new learnings get comfortable, I love that part.

Over the last year I have found it much harder to learn. Things just wont go in or, more commonly, I get frustrated with myself for finding things difficult which hinders everything even more.

Like anything else, learning takes practice. That, and the stress of the last few months has left me with much more grey hair which is definitely a physical representation of the strain. I need to give myself a break.
