Koi No Yokan. A Japanese term that means 'premonition of love'. It's not the same as love at first sight as it doesn't speak to the presence of love, just that it seems inevitable.

If you'd asked me if this was real 6 months ago I wouldn't have believed it for a second. Ask me today, and I'll tell you it absolutely exists.
