A global pandemic and the Instagram algorithm are conspiring against me by showing me a lot of images of New York City. Over the last 15 years I have visited 5 times, both in hotels but also staying with friends who lived on the upper west side of Manhattan (they've since moved, which is pretty rude to be honest).

It might be because of my love on London, but I always feel at ease in New York. I have a set of pretty regular haunts for eating and drinking, walking where I can but also actually liking the subway. I always have loose plans of what I'll do the next time I visit, be that restaurants and bars pinned on a Google map, or a route to cycle north out of the city up to Bear Mountain and back.

Around 2010 I was making plans to live there. I researched the job market, housing, how to get a visa beyond 90 days, how to look into settled status, everything. Now? Not a chance. The city remians incredible but I cannot see myself living the United States. I'm not even totally sure I want to visit while Trump is at the helm. But as soon as it feels right, I'll be back.
