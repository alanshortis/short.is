Some days you get to your desk, look at what needs to be done, and start doing it. Other days, you go in with the best intentions and before you know it you've been sitting there for hours and nothing seems to have happened.

The third type of day is a combination of the two. You have the energy to get stuff done but you end up dealing with so many aspects of the job that are not concerned with delivery that you're busy all day with nothing to show for it.

I'm taking the day off tomorrow, and I intend to make something. Just for myself. No deadlines, no pressure from product owners and no one else's opinions as to how something should or shouldn't be done. Just creating.
