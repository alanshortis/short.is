I've always had a soft spot for live albums. There is something about the more open sound, the unintentional sounds and mistakes that end up in the recording, how the songs have evolved over a tour... For me, all of those things are the market for how great a band is and can be.

There can't be any doubt that Les Zeppelin's [No Quarter](https://open.spotify.com/track/6CaacdmM2MaOV7Pqmru0BW?si=_dL2suLbT-S2wkc28lqIaQ) from The Song Remains the Same soundtrack, recorded live at Madison Square Garden, is the definitive version. The studio recording sounds pedestrian in comparison. It's four musicians at the absolute height of their powers making arguably their most restrained song sound vast and dramatic for more than 10 minutes.

I'm definitely guilty of being irritated by audience participation at live shows that I have attended, but in the case of [Mercy, Mercy, Mercy](https://open.spotify.com/track/6NF8MZ2trxckVBr82pyyPt?si=dwj0ZG7WSlCxlVpMCLJPuA) by Cannonball Adderley, it wouldn't be the same without it. When someone yells 'play that bass!', I'm right there with them.

Finally, I have to mention Vulfpeck, also at [Madison Square Garden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv4wf7bzfFE). I don't think I have ever heard an audience so musical before. Not only do they nail a three part harmony on Back Pocket but also accurately singling the bass line to Dean Town. And the whole show is on YouTube, for free, filmed in a single shot, with a rotating cast of musicians and core band members.

There are far too many examples to choose from, so I'm going to start a rolling and evolving [playlist on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4YoVW4ztKD33uPvUMdfzuB?si=lhWMC-R8R3GfEtJUQpN1sw). I hope you like it.
