I have started writing a few times today and deleted everything after a minute or so.

- Should I buy a better chair for working? Is the plastic chair I've been using contributing to my reduced work rate?
- The weather forecast is for rain over the next week, so what can I do at home to make the most of the time and free myself up for when summer returns?
- Some bullshit about music that's half baked and not really as profound as I think.
- I'm still tired from cycling on Saturday. Or is it something else?

I think it might be something else. The global situation right now is exhausting, and I'm really struggling.
