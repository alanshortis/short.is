The minor obsession with house plants that has formed since being forced to stay home practically 24/7 ('working from home' has become 'living at work') is starting to spread outside.

My small house has a little outdoor area, tastefully finished in mossy concrete and a questionable flowerbed made from poorly stacked bricks which has become a nice place for weeds. I finally weeded, removed a creeper vine doing its best to ruin the brickwork, and started to think about what I want to do to make it an area I'd like to use.

First: A bay tree in a large terracotta pot. On the way, a Japanese maple that's also going to live in a large pot. I probably should be painting the fence and laying down gravel first, but the need to own many plants is just too strong.
