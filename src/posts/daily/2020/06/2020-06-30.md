I'm not really cut out to be a teacher. A certain confidence in subject matter is needed to be able to tell someone else how to do something (and why) with some kind of authority, and as I spend so much time second guessing myself I think it would be difficult for me.

BUT, I do like writing on technical subjects. Recently I have been working on a couple of new repositories at work; a GraphQL proxy and a Pattern Library (to support a new Design System) and I have enjoyed writing the documentation more than the coding (and yes, the context switching between a UI library and Node has been a bit of a ride for me).

Writing lets me gather my thoughts, it lets me read back over what I am trying to say so I can clarify, and it also doesn't often result in questions that need to be answered quickly and clearly.

For me though, writing for other people always comes second to doing it for myself. If I write as I'm trying to figure something out I am much more likely to get it straight in my head. Maybe that's why I seem to be writing about my life more and more?
