Because I've been neglecting the bike, yet again, I'm undergoing a pretty heavy training plan in an attempt to get some fitness back a potential visit to the Alps in September. Not only is 2 hours on the indoor trainer pretty gruelling, it's also good thinking time.

There is a tired trope in cycling around **suffering**. Cyclists like to think of the pain they inflict on themselves as a badge of honour; a show of strength and endurance, and how they can tolerate more than other riders.

I'm not going to use the word 'suffer' in relation to cycling anymore. As amateurs, we make ourselves uncomfortable by choice then brag about it later. And while pro cyclists have a little less choice over their pain, both because it's their job and being able to endure more than the next guy actually has some consequence, they still retire to comfortable lives.

True suffering is not a choice. Being persecuted for your race or for being a refugee or asylum seeker, disability, sexuality and many other causes of true pain and suffering is something so many people cannot opt out of. To use that word to describe our silly little sport is pretty insulting.

Being able to ride hard on thousands of pounds worth of carbon fibre before going home to relax is an immense privilege.
