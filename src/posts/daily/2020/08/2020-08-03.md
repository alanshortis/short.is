I've been very lucky throughout the pandemic for my work to be mostly safe and and reliable. Pay reviews were cancelled and anyone who'd left wasn't replaced but we all felt very lucky.

Unfortunately, that luck has worn a little thin with an annoucement today that there will be redundancies. Around 5% across the business, which means risk of being affected is fairly low, but I'm still worried.

Worried, but also torn. I've been sure for a while that I probably need a change but I want that change to be on my terms. Being pushed makes me nervous as I'm very risk-averse.
