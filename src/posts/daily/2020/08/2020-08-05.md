The last two training rides I have done have given new power records for 10 seconds and 20 seconds, which makes very little sense as what little training I have been doing has been more focussed on longer efforts to try and prepare for long French climbs.

I'm sure someone who truly understands training or physiology could explain it to me, but I suspect it has something to do with the extra 20kg I am carrying since my 'peak' (which is funny because I was _never_ fast) making efforts that rely more on brute force a little more natural.
