I don't really like picture discs. They never sound as good and obviously exist to sell more units, though with the pittance musicians make I can't really be too mad about that. Also, as we're about to cover, I still buy them.

My copy of Clutch - [Jam Room](https://www.discogs.com/Clutch-Jam-Room/release/11045149) is a picture disc, portraying Medusa in reference to the song Release the Kraken. This is also the first clutch album I ever bought because I saw a member of System of a Down wearing a Clutch t-shirt. I don't think this is a good place to start with this band, but it did make me a life-long fan. I got this at Rough Trade in Nottingham, and I remember clearly going in there determined to buy _something_ because I'd had a shitty day at work. Not bad for a sadness purchase.

I have two copies of Book of Bad Decisions, one [gatefold, on 'Coke Bottle Clear' vinyl](https://www.discogs.com/Clutch-Book-Of-Bad-Decisions/release/12483000), and one [double picture disc](https://www.discogs.com/Clutch-Book-Of-Bad-Decisions/release/12491296) which comes in a gatefold clear plastic sleeve, which I've never seen before. This one also came with a sticker signed by all four members of the band. I never met them, it was just included for some reason. They both came from Rough Trade in Nottingham, and the Coke Bottle Clear pressing has a locked groove on side D, which took me an embarrassingly long time to even notice.
