I've a fringe interest in Vinyl for a long time. It started with hip-hop 12" singles which I eventually sold for nothing to some Soho record stores (being broke in London will do that to you) but has started to grow a little more with a solid set of albums. I only have around 200. I should have many more.

A few months ago the Technics aplifier I have had for around 20 years finally gave up, so I have acquired a new one. Born the same year as me, the Audiolab unit I now have sounds absolutely incredible. At least, in comparison to the old one.

I'm sure people roll their eyes when _vinyl guys_ start talking about the _warmth_ of their music when played on a proper turntable, and, I know... We're awful. But at risk of sounding like an absolute idiot, I have to say that your favourite album never sounds as good as it does when it's coming from a clean, 180g LP.
