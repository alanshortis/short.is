Today's records are both by AFX (a pseudonym for Aphex Twin), [Analord 03](https://www.discogs.com/AFX-Analord-03/release/400077) and [Analord 04](https://www.discogs.com/AFX-Analord-04/release/398345).

Like Analord 10, these are both really listenable and unmistakably Aphex. No great mystery for speed today and they sounded absolutely insane at 45, my only complaint is that neither of them last long enough. They'd be amazing for working, but as they do not appear on any streaming service it's impractical to get up every 10 minutes or so to flip the record.

Each of these comes in a platic sleeve which us U shaped with the bottom half holding the record and no having any corners. I've never seen that before.

All the Analord 12" I have came from HMV in Thurrock while I was working there in 2005.
