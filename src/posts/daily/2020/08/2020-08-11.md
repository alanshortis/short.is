Toaday's work day was a change of pace; I was in a design session to sketch out ideas for a new feature. Everyone had some good suggestions, and it was interesting to note how I (a developer) had noticeably different interpretations of the same fundamental aim. Designers made it visual, product people made it something to be sold, and I couldn't help but think of implementation.

It seemed to change something for me. I have been struggling to design a new website for months (150 days actually), with a few attempts leading to some concepts I liked until I went back later and saw them fresh.

Afer work I put together a couple of pages that felt different. Like a move a right direction. Fingers crossed I won't be writing about how much I dislike them in a few days.
