With my turntable back in action and my fairly fickle fascination with vinyl now reignited, I've decided to listen back to everything I own, at least one item per day, and add my collection to [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/). The fact that I have never added anything to discogs before is a sure sign that I'm not quite a true audiophile nerd yet.

My records should be in alphabetical order but I'll do doing this as they come off the shelf, so things may get random. I also have all 10" and 7" records separated from 12". I'll do my best to remember where I got each one from, though despite my collection being pretty modest my memory isn't what it used to be.

First item in the collection is [Aphex Twin - Analord 10](https://www.discogs.com/Aphex-Twin-Analord-10/release/482391), a 12" single. I had to check Discogs to find out what speed it should be played at because Aphex being as he is, it sounded plausible at both 33â…“ and 45rpm.

It's a picture disc with the iconic Aphex Twin logo, and is very listenable (no matter what speed you settle on).
