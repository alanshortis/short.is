With the remoival of the uncertainty of my job, and therefore income, and it now being totally clear that travelling to France is not happening, I booked some time away in North Wales.

There are slews of bunk houses and Airbnbs in Snowdonia, but with the many of them having shared bathrooms or just being in a room in someone's house I opted for a Hotel instead. Far from cheap, but I've been in two rooms for more than 5 months and I need it.

I went to Snowdonia many times around 2005-2008. Once with friends to get to the top of Snowdon in February, where it many degrees below zero and the wind had produced some horizontal icicles. Part of the ascent meant wading through waist-deep snow. I don't recommend it.

Other times I went alone with a small tent and just walked, camping where I could and trying to 'unplug'. The last time is how I originally found the hotel I'm staying in this year. After a very long day in endless rain, I couldn't face the tent and having no means for cleaning myself appropriately for a train journey back to London I got a room with a bath and cooked myself foe several hours.

This time I'll be cycling and tackling some climbs I have admired (from a distance) for years. I'm disappointed to not be visiting the Alps, but I cannot wait to see some familiar and brand new places in what's truly one of the most dramatic parts of the UK.
