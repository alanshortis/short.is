It's pretty hard to improve when in your comfort zone. Because COVID has forced solo cycling for the last few months, I have been able to ease off or ride easier whenever I'd like. That changed today as I rode with two friends who are _vastly_ fitter than I am, which pushed me much harder.

I feel terrible now, but I know it's going to have made a difference.
