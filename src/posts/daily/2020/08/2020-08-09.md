GeoGuessr has been quite addictive for me recently. During meetings where I only need to half pay attention I'll spend some time trying figure out where I am, investigating road signs abd bill boards, and wheelie bins outside houses can often be helpful.

It's one of those games where, the more you play it, the better it gets. You start to recognise road markings and signs, and even people can give a hint as yo where you've landed.

There are people on YouTube who try for perfect scores and go to great lengths to get guesses to the metre. I'm not there yet, but in terms of good ways to procrastinate it could be much worse.
