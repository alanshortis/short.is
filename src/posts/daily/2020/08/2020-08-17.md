In 2015, still close enough to the London Olympics for that wave of optimism and hype to have not yet broken, the Derby velodrome opened and I was all over it. Riding a wood velodrome seemed so inaccessibile for so long, but it looked like fun and I always wanted to try it.

In order to do it, you need to go through a 4 stage accreditation process to learn how to ride the boards correctly. To the uninitiated that could sound weird, but where riding a bike on the road is a largely two dimensional affair, the banked track is definitely 3D. Someone to your right on the bankings is a clear 5 feet higher up than you are, and that takes preparation.

I sold bikes and other possesions in order by the perfect track bike. I finally owned a Condor, and I crashed it my first time out by lunging for the line for the minor places in an unknown distance race. It wasn't even a league race.

I eventually sold the track bike and I haven't been back since. Derby isn't that close, travelling is very time consuming and the cost of limited sessions just made it too difficult when compared to riding the road.

I want to do it again, in part so I can build myself a new bike. The simplicity of track bike is extremely appealing as road bikes get more and complex and technically advanced.
