Boom Bip & Doseone - [Circle](https://www.discogs.com/Boom-Bip-Doseone-Circle/release/1308912) feels a little more like a performance poetry project from Doseone, though when Boom Bip is let loose his production is really clean. 'The Birdcatcher's Return' is the definite highlight, soundline like they made the whole piece together. Vocals and instrumental really well matched. Honestly, I can't remember the last time I really wanted to listen to it.

More Doseone in the form of cLOUDDEAD with the first [self titled](https://www.discogs.com/cLOUDDEAD-cLOUDDEAD/release/24561) album being a 3LP collection of a series of 10" singles. I own these, but will be listening to and documenting them at a later date. I really love this album, mostly because of Odd Nosdam's production which is close to an electronic Godspeed You! Black Emperor at. The second emcee, Why?, has a style that is really complementary of Dose's which you'd never guess was even possible.

[Ten](https://www.discogs.com/cLOUDDEAD-Ten/release/240689) is more of a 'proper' album. Back when I was getting into this I though this album was a bit dumbed down and safe, but all these years later I can see that it's just more focussed. There truly isn't a bad track on this album.

A really good example of how good this music could be can be found on the [Mush Tour film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01uEX6ElgQ). Beyond just live music, there is some genuinely great performance.
