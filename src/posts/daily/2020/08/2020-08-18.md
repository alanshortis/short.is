A post-work walk turned into an 11km excursion to and around the rowing lake just outside of Nottingham. I listened to an entire album that I've not thought about for a while, enjoyed some silence and was alarmed by a particularly aggressive goose.

I didn't really feel like cycling. While I often love the bike, you can't really listen to anything (while riding safely). It's pretty rare that I can digest an album in full.
