Boom Bip - [Blue Eyed in the Red Room](https://www.discogs.com/Boom-Bip-Blue-Eyed-In-The-Red-Room/release/408458) is the first album released by Lex in my collection, and the sleeve design was by eh? who always produced something pretty special. The use of textures, foil, shapes pressed out of the sleeve and incorporating the barcode into the design makes for something really nice to own (even if it means the discgos barcode reader becomes ineffective). The album itself is very Ninja Tune, if you know what I mean. Hard to believe it's been sitting on my shelf for 15 years, and I'm fairly sure it came from HMV in Thurrock.

All of tomorrow's albums are emblematic of my time at HMV. Working with some real hip-hop heads as well as people who were really into the more avant-garde end of the genre, to the point where it's hard to know if it's really hip-hop anymore. With a full plate of work, I can't really listen to these today both for the time needed to play them and for them not being conducive to concentration.
