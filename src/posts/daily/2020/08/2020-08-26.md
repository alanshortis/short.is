I have no idea why I own a copy of Bonnie Prince Billy - [Singer's Grave A Sea Of Tongues](https://www.discogs.com/Bonnie-Prince-Billy-Singers-Grave-A-Sea-Of-Tongues/release/6103133). I'm not really into this at all, though I have to say that New Black Rich (Tusks) is pretty great but that only represents a 10% hit rate. The record was also incredibly dusty when it came out of the sleeve so it must have had some use at some point. As this came out in 2014 I would guess it came from Rough Trade in Nottingham.

[Biophilia](https://www.discogs.com/Bj%C3%B6rk-Biophilia/release/3163861) is probably my second favourite Björk album after Vespertine, which I don't own. Why are so many of the gaps in my collection albums I absolutely love? Both of these albums have that perfect blend of vocal performance, delicacy, and electronic experimentation that really works for me. I've only see Björk live once and it was at Glastonbury so hardly a totally fair representation. The [concert film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuV-EXKsbtI) for this album is incredible, and of course there is a Tesla coil on stage. I probably bought this at Rough Trade in Nottingham.

Björk - [The Gate](https://www.discogs.com/Bj%C3%B6rk-The-Gate/release/10824256) was limited to 10,000 copies (though when talking about a 12" single, how _limited_ is that, really?) and is single sided. Just one track on one side, with the other side being totally untouched. The inside of the sleeve is a printed spectrum of colour.

Finally, Björk - [Utopia](https://www.discogs.com/Bj%C3%B6rk-Utopia/release/11154874). This is a limited edition peach coloured vinyl that was exclusive to Rough Trade, so once again I would have got this at the Nottingham store. The combination of Björk and Arca's production makes this album so sumptuous.
