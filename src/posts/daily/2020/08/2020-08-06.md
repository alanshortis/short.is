Social media used to be harmful because it showed people living perfect lives, but those lives were entirely false and fabricated. Setting impossible standards that people could never live up to, making them feel like failures as a result.

That's obviously still an issue, but now it feels as if we've moved into a period where the most vapid, empty bullshit is pushed front and centre.

It's probably still possible to tailor instagram so that I see the content I want, but the new 'Reels' feature (a competitor to TikTok) is being pushed very hard. Trying to convince people that anyone can be a _creator_ or an _influencer_.

The truth is, it's not for me. I'm too old. I'm old enough to have kids that would lap all of this stuff up. I think it's dumb. No one cares that I feel that way. I won't be missed. Jaded, out of touch people aren't going to be missed.
