Writing about coding is on the the bettsr ways I have found to learn, and the subject I've chosen for a short series of posts is something I really should have nailed down for my career: React hooks.

I write React daily, but with the tasks I pick up tending to be more focussed on UI and accessibility it's rare I have to do much at all with data. Therefore, the intricacies of modern React is still pretty alien to me.

Hooks are still fairly new, and as such the official React documentation still doesn't properly cover them.
