When working for HMV, I worked on an in-store system called TRACK. Apparenrly it didn't stand for anything, but was still all in capitals. It based on IBM's AS-400, all text based, green screens, it's own means for crating queries for data but also supported some rudimentary SQL.

The first large web project I did was a web based (well, HMV's intranet so by 'web based' I mean 'ran in a browser) dashboard to summarise data that originated inside TRACK. This sounds official, but I literally just googled for AS-400 connection strings, used my own user ID for auth, then threw together some classic ASP.

I think it's important to remember things like this from the past. Of all the things I have built over the last 13 years as a developer, I have taught myself almost everything I needed.
