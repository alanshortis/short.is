Today we start to drift into what _a lot_ of my collection is - instrumental and back-packer hip-hop. My brief stint trying to DJ meant playing a lot of this stuff at 93 Feet East, often playing a whole instrumental version of something before then playing the whole of the vocal version. I thought it was good, but in hindsight, no one was dancing (I was playing the bar, but still) let alone even really playing attention.

Anyway. Blendcrafters - [Blend Crafter Vol.1](https://www.discogs.com/Blendcrafters-Blend-Crafters-Volume-1/release/1250285) is a project of DJ Nu Mark or Jurassic 5, so a lot of the beats are pretty good if you like that style. The opening track has a vocal sample, and it's a bit of a pet hate of mine. It's not the typical chipmunk style which crops up so often in the awful stock music that appears in YouTube vlogs but it's pretty close. All in all, there is some good stuff in here (the cover of Imagine is so bad it makes me uncomfortable) but I'd much rather hear someone rhyme over these instrumentals. The pressing is clearly for DJs - very wide grooves and just 2 tracks per side despite being 33. I have no idea where I bought this.

Blockhead - [Music by Cavelight](https://www.discogs.com/Blockhead-Music-By-Cavelight/release/2131981) and the single [Sunday Séance](https://www.discogs.com/Blockhead-Sunday-S%C3%A9ance/release/342342) suffer a little from the aforementioned vocal samples and some are crying out for an emcee which should make the one appearance from Aesop Rock really welcome but doesn't. They have that slow, downtempo feel that is definitely inspired by DJ Shadow, if not quite as technically adept. Sunday Séance is really good, even with the vocal sample. These albums really mark the time period for me, when anything on [Ninja Tune](https://www.discogs.com/label/109-Ninja-Tune) or Warp was essential listening. Now, more than 15 years later, I can't honestly say I ever really think about listening to them.

Despite the terrible title and cover, Busdriver - [Cosmic Cleavage](https://www.discogs.com/Busdriver-Cosmic-Cleavage/release/257259) is great. I love his style, complex and abstract, and I like the instrumentals too. These are the exact kind of tracks that would sound dated or crude without the emcee, but with them, it's so good. 'Kev's Blistering Computer Tan And Driver's Rapper's Rapper Moniker' is the perfect blend of a heavy beat, turntablism (to complement the track and not jusy exhibitionism) and the interplay of the vocals... It's pretty perfect. I might listen to this album twice.

Busdriver [Fear Of A Black Tangent](https://www.discogs.com/Busdriver-Fear-Of-A-Black-Tangent/release/403240) is _maybe_ a more accomplished album? Maybe technically, but I don't enjoy it as much as Cosmic Cleavage. SOme production from Danger Mouse is always welcome, and this is no exception. I have to say though, I can only listen to so much Busdriver before I need a break. His vocals are very busy and really need some attention to decipher what's actually being said (and that effort isn't always that rewarding).
