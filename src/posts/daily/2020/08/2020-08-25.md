Before today's listening I fitted some new speaker cable with banana plugs, and it's extremely surprising how much difference it's actually made over the cheap cable I had before. I can hear a lot more hi-hat, and the whole sound is a less bogged-down. It did unfortunately lead me to reading about the pros and cons of bi-wiring and looking at new speakers. I really can't justify that cost right now.

Baby Huey - [The Baby Huey Story (The Living Legend)](https://www.discogs.com/Baby-Huey-The-Baby-Huey-Story-The-Living-Legend/release/8425654) is an album I bought purely for the song Hard Times. Heavily sampled, and one of the coldest and hardest breaks I've ever heard, this track and the whole album is a clear influence on what would become hip hop. Baby Huey died at just 26. I bought this at Rough Trade in Nottingham, and it's a reissue.

Battles - [EP C/B EP](https://www.discogs.com/Battles-EP-C-B-EP/release/8331987) is a reissue of the 2 EPs released by battles before the breakthrough album Mirrored. It ranges from really clean, minimal, post/math rock tracks and experiments that possibly shouldn't have made it onto a release in my opinion. I think I bought this at HMV Greenwich (which was actually in Charlton, but Greenwich sounds much better) and was working there at the time.

Beastie Boys - [Paul's Boutique](https://www.discogs.com/Beastie-Boys-Pauls-Boutique/release/47802) is obviously an absolute masterpiece. Along with De La Soul, it's the seminal demonstration of making an album entirely from samples. Mine is an early 90s reissue and has some cracks and pops throughout, but I really don't mind it. The album sounds a little odd to me without them. I'm pretty sure this came from Sister Ray in London, second hand.

Beastie Boys - [To The 5 Boroughs](https://www.discogs.com/Beastie-Boys-To-The-5-Boroughs/release/1353766) is not my favourite Beastie Boys album. This is probably because it follows Hello Nasty which is easily in my top 10 albums of all time (but strangely, I don't own) so it didn't really matter what they did, it was never going to compare. It may also be because it's a pure rap album, and it's their variety of musicianship that I really appreciate. This is the original release from 2004, and it's pretty cheap lightweight vinyl but comes in an awesome gatefold with all the lyrics positioned around the buildings on a hand drawn image of the New York skyline, complete with the World Trade Centre. This came from HMV in Thurrock, putting my staff discount to good use.
