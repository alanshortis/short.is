Sunday dread is a very real thing. 5pm comes round and the threat of Monday morning comes into sharp focus. We're mere hours away from another full week of work.

I've had jobs where I didn't feel this way. I wouldn'y say I loved those jobs or that I was keen to get into it at the start of a new week, but I didn't actually make me feel different.

It's true that you get out what you put in. It's hard to adhere to that when the job you do makes you feel worthless.
