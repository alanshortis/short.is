I've really missed Pro Cycling. I wasn't really ever into sport, but being deprived on it during the early part of the summer has made it's return extremely welcome.

Tomorrow is Milan San Remo, a race that is usually run in the spring and is the longest on the calendar at nearly 300km. I plan to watch all the available live coverage while looking at some maps.

I decided 100% not to do La Marmotte cycling event in France, and instaed make sure the week is free of pressure. I still intend to do a long ride on that Saturday, but it being on my terms will make a huge difference. I'm excited for cycling again.
