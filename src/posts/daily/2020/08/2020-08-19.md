The risk of being made reduntant from my job was a very real sword hanging over my head for a few weeks. My feeling of unhappiness with my whole career (not just my job) and how difficult I have found it to be productive since lockdown had convinced me that I was likely for the chop.

One day I'd think logically and realise that losing developers would mean they couldn't scale up the dev team in the future, but other days that just didn't enter into it at all: I was done for.

Today, it was confirmed that no developers would be being made redundant. I had no idea how tense I really was, because as the news was delivered I felt drastically physically different.

Stress is very harmful. I need less.
