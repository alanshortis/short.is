Two more Apex Twin albums today - [Come to Daddy](https://www.discogs.com/Aphex-Twin-Come-To-Daddy/release/3903368), and Drukqs.

Come to Daddy is probably best known for the midly terrifying [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZ827lkktYs) and the fact that he apparently made it as an answer to the The Prodigy's Firestarter. The title track is immediately follwed by Flim, a sublime composition that should be thrown at anyone who tries to claim electronic music can't be truly musical.

I vividly remember the first time I heard Bucephalus Bouncing Ball on the [Pi soundtrack](https://www.discogs.com/Various-%CF%80-Music-For-The-Motion-Picture/release/21351) and thinking it was the most ridiculous, ambitious and amazing thing I'd heard at the time. Finally, the Little Lord Faulteroy Mix of Come to Daddy is another gorgeous piece of music that is, to be honest, ruined by childrens voices being used. It makes a bit uncomfortable and I'm certain that was the intention.

[Drukqs](https://www.discogs.com/Aphex-Twin-Drukqs/release/13966) is a LP boxset and possibly the most valuable piece I have. It's not in amazing condition, with the signs of having moved house several times and it being too big to properly fit on a shelf being visible. It's been a fairly prized possesion, and I;ve managed to resist the urge to sell it quite a few times.

The album is wonderful. The piano compositions perfectly at odds with some of the most acid-drenched tracks I have ever heard. I really hope my neighbours like this too, because my fiest listen on vinyl for at least 10 years had to be given some volume.
