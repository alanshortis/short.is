It makes no sense at all, but heat is so much more oppresive when you're in your home town than when you're abroad. I cycled in 30 degree heat last night and I really struggled. I couldn't keep my heart rate down, and in just 32 miles I was absolitely spent.

In 2015 I was cycling in the Alps and experienced 40 degrees for several days and I absolutely loved it. I felt much more energetic and did some of my strongest riding.

The real answer is actually nothing to do with temperature. Yesterday I simply didn't eat enough. Trying to manage my weight means restricting some calories, whereas when I am in the Alps specifically to ride I eat everything in sight 24/7.

It doesn't matter that I have been riding for many years, I still mess up when it comes to fuel. I run out of energy and I get home with full water bottles embarrassingly often.
