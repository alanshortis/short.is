Danger Mouse - [The Grey Album](https://www.discogs.com/Danger-Mouse-Jay-Z-The-Grey-Album/release/1991119) takes the acapellas from Jay-Z's Black Album and builds all the instrumentals from The Beatles White Album. Hence the name. For me, this is vastly better than the Black Album and was the first glimpse at Danger Mouse's prowess before huge projects with MF DOOM and Ceelo.

I bought this at HMV on Oxford Street. It was never legally for sale because of the sample clearances, and it's not eligible for sale on discogs even now, so I don't really know how the largest UK retailer (at the time) was able to stock it without getting into any hot water. The London stores in particular did stock various white label singles to try and lure in DJs, and these came from tiny suppliers who had a relationship with people with buying power in stores, not head office.

It's been more than 8 years since I left HMV, and 13 since I was on the shop floor so I don't know this for sure, but I'll bet money that no one outside of the head office is able to order anything to be stocked anymore. HMV is now really a shop window for labels to push their products even they end up being purchased somewhere else.
