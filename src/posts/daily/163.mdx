New Mac day. The 2019 Intel MacBook Pro is gone. Trying to open a negative scan in Lightroom had the fans spinning, actually editing had horrific latency and occasional crashes from overheating.

I don't think 4 years for a MacBook Pro is great, but that's on me for scrimping on RAM. When I bought it I was only doing pretty lightweight front end dev with a text editor. And it's still very good at that. If the RAM wasn't soldered to the board I could have just upgraded.

I think Â£1 a day is a reasonable cost, and with the trade-in value I exceeded this easily. Paying for 32GB or RAM might get me closer to 50p.
