Every single day I look at the clock at 13:37. It might me when I check the time deliberately, it might be when I pick up my phone for a message, it might be when I glance at the clock for no apparent reason.

I know someone else with a similar thing. He needs to see `2222` every day, so often he sees the clock later in the evening or sees the numbers (or a very close approximation) on car number plates. He told me about this while we were driving through France, where he pointed out a mile marker with the magic numbers more than once.
