When I have no idea what I want to listen to (often) I limit my options in some way. It's really good for digging out some albums I haven't thought about for a long time, or listening to ones I love really closely. Finding the difference between music as background noise and it being something to really listen to.

Today's music was from 1995. I was 12 and just starting to get interested in music shops while being firmly on the correct side of Blur vs Oasis. GZA, Deftones, and The Chemical Brothers delivering music my Dad hated across three genres while I clearly remember my mother referring to Bj√∂rk as 'that silly girl'.
