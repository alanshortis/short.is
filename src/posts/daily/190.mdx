When Spotify added lyrics - that light up in time to the music - to their app they probably had a vision of parties or someone singing Rebecca Black into a hairbrush while getting ready for work on a Friday.

I love that it also allows you to read the apocalyptic narration of [The Dead Flag Blues](https://genius.com/Godspeed-you-black-emperor-the-dead-flag-blues-lyrics) as it opens up in front of you.

> We woke up one morning and fell a little further down<br/>For sure as the valley of death<br/>I open up my wallet<br/>And it's full of blood

My only note: It would be better with Mickey's head bouncing on each syllable.
