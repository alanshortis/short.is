Those irritating early risers who proclaim that the morning is the 'best part of the day' are annoyingly correct. It's quiet, you're not still waking up when it's time to have a work-brain, a general feeling of productivity. It's good, but bed is warm and comfortable.

This isn't some flex. I haven't become one of those people who gets up at 5am to get it. I went to sleep at about 2, managed two hours of weird abstract dreams about what I needed to do at work the following day, and eventually gave up and got up at 4:30.

I'm not sure I'm capable of making this a habit yet.
