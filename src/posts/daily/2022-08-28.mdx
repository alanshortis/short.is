A first lap collision between Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso put Lewis out the race. Alonso immediately gets on the radio, calling him an idiot and making claims about his race craft, or lack of.

Later, while being interviewed for Sky, they tried to tell Lewis what had been said and he immediately cut them off with 'I don't care', and accepted responsibility for the incident. I love this so much; the opinion of a rival who he already has history with was of absolutely no use to him. Most people would be curious, maybe even want an opportunity to dismiss it or defend themselves. But what would that actually achieve?

Hamilton's mental strength is crazy. The way he composed himself at the end of last season was unbelievable, congratulating Max Verstappen before quietly disappearing for the off-season. To this day has never talked about it, because like today's incident, what would be gained from opening that box?
