Technical choices for this daily writing experiment:

- No tags or categorisation.
- No searching.
- No way to link to a particular post and no pagination.
- No pictures.

Some of these decisions were made in order to keep it as simple as possible, others just need more time to figure out. How would I handle linking to specific posts? How would pagination work? These aren't hard problems to solve in React, but I want to stay as faithful to the low/no JavaScript dream as possible. There is no reason to send ANY JavaScript to a site that hosts static text.

But to be real for a second, there is a fair chance that I abandon this project entirely. MVPs aren't just for new business ideas, they're for flaky 'writers' who will run out of derivative observations really quickly, too.
