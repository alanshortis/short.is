The very best thing about owning and tending to a personal website is that I can relive and remember how I got into building for the web in the first place: using the web as a means to play with design ideas. Over a few hours today I have revamped all the typography, dropping a variable font in favour of separated fonts agin, and trying some new CSS font features to get everything just so.

I'm far from an expert in typography but the parity between the heading, body, and code fonts makes everything just a little more balanced. To me, it's a huge difference. To anyone else, even side by side they'd probably just shrug.
