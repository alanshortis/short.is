The YouTube algorithm seems to really lean into demographics more heavily than my viewing history. Being a straight, white, male millennial seems to push a lot of Joe Rogan and Joran Peterson my way, despite never looking for that kind of content with any intentionality.

I'm so worried that YouTube are going to figure out that I work in tech, I watch any code tutorials or courses with a different account. Doing it on main is just going to bring out Elon Musk, the dumbest 'smart' person I can name.
