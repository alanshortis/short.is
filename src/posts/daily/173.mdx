The first time I recognised a sample in music was Spin Doctor's Two Princes, which appeared in Sad but True, by Orbital. I excitedly told my Dad about this, and he told me that sampling was nothing more than theft and was not a legitimate approach to making music.

Years later, he heard some DJ Shadow and was visibly irritated to have to admit that this album made entirely from samples was actually a masterpiece.

Sampling probably hit its peak in the late 80s and early 90s, with [Paul's Boutique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul%27s_Boutique) and [3 Feet High and Rising](3_Feet_High_and_Rising) being musical collage. The clearance of samples (not something that was that stringest back then) is why there is no De La Soul on streaming services before a certain point, though that is set to change very soon.

Famously, to sample Lou Reed on their most well known track, Can I Kick It?, A Tribe Called Quest had to [surrender](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/tribe-called-quest-lou-reed-got-all-the-money-for-can-i-kick-it-71760/) 100% of the royalties and publishing.

I'm no crate digger, but I maintain a [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6oLKrRpE4e5aY5u1G6xHDt?si=6992706491d541d9) of originals and samples that I update as I notice them through regular listening.
