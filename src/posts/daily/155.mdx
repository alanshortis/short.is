[Blue Monday](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Monday_(date)>) may have been invented by a travel company to encourage people to book holidays, but this point of the year is pretty bleak. It's still dark, it's still several weeks until the end of winter, and spring leading to summer feels unattainable.

So really, if booking a holiday and having something real to look forward is going to help, do it. It makes the void look much easier to jump.
