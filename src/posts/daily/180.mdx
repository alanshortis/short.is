I have been noodling around with a refresh for this site. It once used [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) (like everyone else), it now uses [SÃ¶hne](https://klim.co.nz/collections/soehne/), but I think I want to do something totally different. I don't have the guts to use [Select Mono](http://michaeljmcmaster.com/selectmono) or [Vulf](https://ohnotype.co/fonts/vulf).

Serif fonts always look classy in newsprint and in the specimens of type foundries but I can never quite pull it off for my own work. There is a definite nuance to setting them than just doesn't seem to be as pivotal as when using a sans serif. And when it comes to pairing? Forget it. I am not skilled enough to make good choices, and I would really like to keep the page weight as low as possible.

I have a desire to only use system fonts but also a desire for things to look at least a little unique and considered, so aggressive sub-setting will have to be the compromise I make.
