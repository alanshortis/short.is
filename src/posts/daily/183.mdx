The more stuff (literally and figuratively) you accumulate the harder it is to travel light and be agile. It's all got to be lugged around or stored. It might need to be considered before making decisions. It might not be possible to do certain things.

But there is also comfort in stuff. Entertainment or familiarity and nostalgia.

I feel heavy.
