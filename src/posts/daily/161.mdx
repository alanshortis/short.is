I understand that being in the middle/middle at the cinema is the best place to sit. And arriving early, that's exactly where I parked myself. But What kind of people decide to sit right beside someone who's already there in an otherwise empty room?

To my left, an older couple rustling their popcorn. To my right, a big guy breathing loudly and fidgeting. After a few minutes, I moved to an entirely empty row. Which all could have been avoided if they'd just chosen better in the first place.
