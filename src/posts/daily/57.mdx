Idea for Lego: Set rental. I want to enjoy the process of building a set, taking it from the component parts and taking it to the complete model but I don't then want that model around. I can take them apart again and store them in the boxes but it's still something to store, more plastic bricks, and lower resale value (especially if there were numbered bags).

If I could rent the models I like the look of, build them, dismantle them, then return them, I'd be more willing to try more out. I could also build the Titanic without spending [north of Â£500](https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/lego-titanic-10294).
