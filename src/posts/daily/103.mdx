There is a trope in cycling that when things get really hard, a rider is suffering. I absolutely hate it.

Rides can be difficult; endurance, an all out effort, relentless weather, wind, or mechanical issues. The supposed suffering is self-imposed. The ride can end, be cut short, or you can just sit up and go easy until you see a cafe or a shop that can sell something sugar-packed and tasty. I've diverted to a train station to get home, added extra cafe stops, and during my first Etape du Tour, stop to sit in the shade to cool down.

People with no choice but to press on in the face of illness, migration, war... That's what suffering actually is. Not a tough bike on on an expensive triangle of carbon fibre, sometimes being given a medal at the end.
