When I worked in retail I'd occasionally encounter older customers who really wanted to talk. A lot. About nothing to do with their purchase. And it was because they hadn't spoken to anyone for a while.

Today, with a couple of opportunities to be social, I fell into the same trap. Catching myself talking far too much about something no one really cares about, just because it's been too long since I spoke to someone in a non-work setting.
