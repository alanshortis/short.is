How do I get a job making title sequences (apart from talent, vision, and technical ability)?

I just finished watching the newest season of [The Crown](https://youtu.be/yJdrrrIT8hQ) (I know) and the abstract flowing of liquid gold to eventually be cast into a crown might be slightly on the nose, but it still does a great job of setting the scene. It even says 'The Crown' over the image of the crown. The Skip Intro button means you probably only see it the first time, or when you can't find the remote under the sofa cushions.

[The Sopranos](https://youtu.be/mJpNmYeooQE) probably has the most famous title sequence of all. Tony, driving from New York (where he wields little) into a rotting New Jersey and. Masculinity in the form of a big truck, big arms and a big cigar while he observes the land he controls, but a land that is in deep decay.

[Se7en](https://youtu.be/-BJkDyCdw0c) combines Nine Inch Nails and a montage of John Doe's meticulous process and documentation of his victims before we know anything about him. After finding his apartment, forensics tell a detective that they haven't found a single finger print, except we already saw someone taking a razor blade to their fingers before the movie really began. I'll bet there are people who would claim to have spotted this on their first watch, but they didn't. Layered detail to encourage repeated views, even in an aspect of the production that's usually pretty disposable.

EastEnders. A reversed plummeting spiral into the east end of London to show us that, yes, this is the East End in case the name of the show didn't do it. Maybe this isn't a good example.
