The Casey Neistat daily vlogs became an essential part of my day. When he moved to Los Angeles and his posts became much less frequent I lost interest. For me, his studio and New York City were characters, and them not longer featuring killed a lot of the appeal.

Casey's brother, Van, has his own channel and it carries a lot of the same home-made, DIY aesthetic. Engraving new possessions or creations, making something if buying it is expensive or it simply doesn't exist, and making the work space as functional as possible. It makes it obvious that a lot of the features of Casey's studio were conceived by Van.

Tom Sachs. A New York based artist. Van worked in his studio for a long time and was given a lot of autonomy to create videos including the amazing [Ten Bullets](https://youtu.be/49p1JVLHUos). But the aesthetic is definitely Tom's, and it definitely influenced Van, who definitely influenced Casey.
