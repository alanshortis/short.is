The 2010 World Cup in South Africa was notable for the advent of the vuvuzela. A plastic horn that creates as loud drone, especially when tens-of-thousands of them are beibg blown at once in a stadium.

It became such a constant theme of the tournament that YouTube added a button to play the drone over any video, just to provide the option of ruining everything you watched for a few weeks.

Vuvuzelas are banned at this World Cup, along with inflatables, any food, and going shirtless.
