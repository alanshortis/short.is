As a non-drinker I like that there are some good 0% or 0.5% beer options. I still like a cold beer, even if I don't want the extra effects of the booze. On more than one occasion I've ordered an alcohol free drink and for whatever reason something was lost between my table and the bar, resulting in me being served a regular 5% beer.

At least when ordering a coke they're not going to to accidentally add some Jack Daniels.
