Last night was probably the best live music experience of my life, and that's against some tough competition. In [Birdland](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birdland_(New_York_jazz_club)>), eating one of the best steaks of my life with a glass of Malbec, a fantastic band featuring [Steve Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KTaVJYUekY) played the entirely of [Giant Steps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Steps), flawlessly.

Every member of the band was extraordinary, but Steve Smith is as good a drummer as anyone has ever been at anything. After holding time perfectly for the duration of the set, he got the last solo and the biggest reaction from the audience. It felt improvised, but featured parts of a [solo of his on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_T4YXhnveA) that I've probably watched 50 times.
