I've had a recurring dream for years where I wake up convinced that someone is either in the house, or due to visit very soon and I need to tidy up.

Having stayed in 4 hotels over the last two weeks this dream has evolved into waking in a panic that I have missed checkout time or I have left the door to my room wide open for some reason.
