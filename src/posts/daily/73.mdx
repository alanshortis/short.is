Since the pandemic customer service has really taken a nose dive. Airlines, who weren't exactly good before, now seem to make it as difficult as possible to do anything related to a booking. BA in particular are still using COVID as an excuse for slower responses and push you to use their absolutely dreadful website. If you try and call there is a good chance they'll hang up on you.

Restaurants being so bad is probably a little more complicated. Very slow inattentive service and absolutely filthy seating areas are the norm, but with delivery/collection in such high demand I think those orders are probably given priority. Someone eating in might make a comment to their server or the manager about needing to wait longer, but someone looking at the order progress on an app so they know when to put some pants on is just a few taps from leaving a bad review or trying to get at least some of their money back.
