Driving anywhere and planning travel away from home makes me feel much more comfortable than being at home. In a world of money being no object I don't think I'd stop travelling. Closing the door to a hotel room is one of my favourite feelings.

This is a step beyond loving travel; it's a desire to run away from the life I have. And that's a feeling that simply isn't sustainable.
