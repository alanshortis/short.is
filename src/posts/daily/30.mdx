Figma has been purchased by Adobe. Not a massive surprise as Adobe haven't really managed to get XD off the ground despite endorsements from twitter-famous industry people and special offers to businesses that use their products elsewhere. And they bought all of Macromedia to get hold of Flash, so...

Obviously the Twitter reaction is one of outrage, with people even claiming they'll find a new design tool. Faux outrage at something that is unlikely to impact them in any way, and another excuse to show just how correct they are. Always.
