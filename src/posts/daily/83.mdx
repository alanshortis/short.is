Proposal: nothing new for two years. No more JavaScript frameworks, no more films, books, TV shows, albums, and for gods sake no more podcasts. Things that exist can be maintained and iterated, so you can get your new Joe Rogan episodes, but sales of expensive microphones on boom arms in the faces of boring white men will take a hit under this policy. Sorry Shure.

Just two years. Two years to breathe, finally watch essential movies, that obscure Scandinavian drama, and the books gathering dust on your shelves, understand Tout Mask Replica. In software, what we already have will get attention and improvements, the endless reinvention can stop smothering engineers, and we'll have better tools that are better understood as a result.
