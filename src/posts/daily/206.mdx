> Sopranos and Breaking Bad spoilers.

Tony Soprano is an absolute monster, and yet you end up rooting for him through six seasons of atrocities. A lot of people say the turning point for Walter White is when he fails to save Jane from choking, but he kills someone in the first episode.

Carmela gets upset with Tony for his actions, Skylar gets upset with Walt for his. And while there is a lot of to be said for how they enable and fail to leave their husbands they still catch far more hate than the murdered and sociopaths that litter both shows.
