There was a moment of the funeral today that will stay with me. A piper who could be heard by the funeral party in the chapel, walking away from the camera, and fading away until they could no longer be heard.

It was a beautiful, touching moment following a long display of precision and duty from a huge array of military personnel. The huge number of Sailors pulling a pristine gun carriage and 6 men with the vast weight of carrying the coffin, both literally and figuratively. Apparently the lead-lined English Oak casket weighed between 250 and 300kg unladen.
