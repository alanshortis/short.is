I'm no royalist, but I also don't feel the need to make staunch republicanism part of my personality. Being in London and then on a busy train as the news of the Queen's death spread I was struck by how many people were making an effort to show that they don't care, or were even glad. Glib remarks about the wealth of the Royal Family in comparison to energy bills, as if one has anything at all to do with the other, was a very low point from a man who literally had the key to his Tesla on the table in front of him.

The Royal family is far from perfect, for obvious reasons. That doesn't make revelling in the death of someone who has been a constant in the lives of the majority of people acceptable.
