title: 'On Ken Block'

I'm not a petrol head. I love my car and I love driving but I am never going to be able to afford a true performance car, I am never going to modify what I have to make it look like one, and I'm never going to buy any Hoonigan merch and do donuts in a Sainsbury's car park.

However, I really like driving skill, scary precision, the [Ford RS200](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_RS200), and loud engines. I think this comes down to being a boy and growing up in Essex where a fast Ford was an object of desire. I can see that the wing on a [Sierra RS Cosworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Sierra_RS_Cosworth) looks absurd but given the choice between that and any Ferrari or Lambourghini and I know what I'm choosing.

Ken Block taking a 1,400 horsepower Mustang up Pikes Peak, mostly sideways, is one of my most viewed [videos on YouTube](https://youtu.be/Hg6L_7qLIEQ). The combination of ability and balls required to pull it off is astonishing. It's loud and brash and a little obnoxious and amazing.

His death yesterday in a snowmobile accident is a huge loss. He was a true one-off.
