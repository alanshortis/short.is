Current status: Three or four ideas a day for daily writing, but by the time I have a minute to sit down and write they're all gone. I am going to jot down ideas as they come to me throughout the day as an aid to memory (and maybe as an excuse to buy some nice Tom Sachs note books).

I really don't like writing about writing, but some days I'm just completely spent from work and don't quite have the brain to come up with an idea. When I have an idea, it usually flows pretty well regardless of how tired I am.

I don't know what this daily writing is. It's not a diary. I don't really share anything especially personal (because, wow, that would be a can of worms right now), and it's entirely separate from technical [writing](/writing). It's more writing to write. A discipline. And I should probably be a little more organised about it.
