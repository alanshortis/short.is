Snowflakes and games of [Go](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)>) are said to be totally unique. There has never been two the same.

When exploring a city without a specific destination, and especially when carrying a camera, I walk in an aimless way. I take turns that look interesting, I might go round in a circle, I might just turn walk back the way I came.

I wonder if I have ever walked a route through a city that no one else has ever walked before?
