New Presidents make their first 100 days in office a benchmark for success, pledging enact particular policies in that time. It started with FDR whose bold plans for change meant his term began with a three month special session to quickly turn around effects of the great depression.

JFK played down the significance of what could be done in 100 days, claiming that some things might never be accomplished but it's important is that we start.

I can't see that point of view being widely accepted in today's world of short attention spans and tribalism. Fast gratification over long term improvement is what gets people on side.
