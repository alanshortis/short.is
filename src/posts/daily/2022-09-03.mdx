Making useless stuff is important. There are a lot of variations of [Useless Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useless_machine), with the most common being a machine whose only purpose is to switch itself off once switched on.

After a chat about the `marquee` tag at work this week (I'm sure web people talk about that weird relic at least once a month) I made something useless of my own. Marrying the deprecated marquee tag with a feature of a now obsolete technology, the DVD player screen saver. It's on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/alanshortis/pen/gOzYbQa), only really works properly on Chrome, and I have yet to see it hit the corner.
