When recording music with microphones there is the chance of picking up sounds that aren't intentional. Fingers on guitar strings, the pedals on a piano, and even the clicking of a cross fader on a turn table while a DJ is scratching.

A 'pure' recording might only pick up the intended sounds, but I really like the imperfections. It lets you know there is a human involved.
