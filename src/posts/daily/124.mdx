Special edition: World Cup Final observations from someone highly Football ignorant:

- Overhead in the post office earlier: 'I hate the French on principle, but I can't root for Argentina because of the Falklands'
- Argentina have a great anthem. My knowledge of anthems comes from Formula One, so it's extremely limited
- Are Argentina the most inked team?
- I think Messi is the greatest of all time, but only because Piers Morgan thinks it's Ronaldo
- Surely a spot-kick for a penalty is too easy? I'd rather see it done as it is in Ice Hockey; one on one, from the half-way line
- The commentator, whose name I don't know, just said 'DO cry for me, Argentina' which has made this worth watching
- Something may have happened in the last 10 minutes but I stopped paying attention
- Why do the pundits wear suits for the final? Rio Ferdinand looks like he's borrowed his for a funeral
- There are a lot of empty seats in the stadium. Much like cycling events in the middle east, it's more about a TV audience and promoting tourism than actually hosting the sport
- A near constant for the last few weeks has been my neighbour screaming at his TV, and tonight is no exception
- Someone give the commentary team some Red Bull
- With the amount of agony felled players seem to be in, I'm surprised we don't see more deaths
- I have headed a football played at pace just once, and it fucking hurts. I also couldn't use my left foot, so my very short time playing football was never going to go anywhere
- When did 'set piece' become a term? When I loved football, Gazza still played for Tottenham so it's probably been decades
- The Gold and Royal Blue of France looks great, but the crest on the Argentina kit is beautiful
- An Argentine named 'Mac Allister' and a Frenchman named 'Hernandez' shows that a surname is pretty useless for guessing where someone is from
- I'm quite bored of this now
- Galaxy brain commentator telling us that this is the highest attendance since 1994 because it's the largest stadium since then
- [Goal! And another!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhlx43rTs2Q)
- Seeing Emmanuel Macron in attendance makes me almost wish we'd had the opportunity to see Liz Truss trying to act like she knew what the fuck was going on
- There are currently three players on the ground looking as if they need a defibrillator
- I think the French goalkeeper is telepathic
- Considering how watch enthusiasts feel about Hublot, it makes sense that they sponsor the substitution board in a middle-eastern world cup
- Is it possible to admire how impressive this stadium is while also being disgusted at how it was built and funded?
- I'm absolutely torn on VAR being an essential tool for fair play and a device for sucking any soul out of tight situations
- A penalty to decide that there will be more penalties says it all
- I'm beginning to wonder if I should have gone to a restaurant and taken advantage of it being quiet
- The decider for a weeks-long tournament coming down to penalties is a bit weak. But, the way Messi plays them is just absurd
- The audacity of the BBC iPlayer app asking me if I am still watching. For the first time, I'm actually not sure

Well, that was eventful. Maybe I'll do this again in 4 years.
