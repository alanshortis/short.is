Having recently moved into a new place, it's become very clear that I am invading the habitat of many, many spiders. Every morning I walk into a newly spun web across a doorway before discovering a new bite or two. Every afternoon I go on a seek-and-destroy mission with the vacuum cleaner. Every evening I find yet another arachnid in a corner.

I haven't seen a single fly for more than a month, but there has to be some middle ground.
