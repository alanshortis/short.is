How easy is it to separate the art from the artist? I always liked Louis CK as a comedian but the revelations of his conduct really soured his act, not least because some of his bits felt a little too weird when we could see how much truth was in them. Does Eric Gill's history of child abuse make his sculpture and typefaces any less remarkable? Coco Chanel was a nazi sympathiser, but does that make No. 5 smell bad?

Gary Glitter didn't make any great albums, so he can go and take all of his music with him. Michael Jackson made thriller, so we can't entertain that he might have been a monster because that means I can't listen to Bad unironically anymore.
