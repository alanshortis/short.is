I have broken down on the motorway three times.

The first was on a french motorway. Running out of fuel at the bottom off the on-ramp for the petrol station after missing the off-ramp somehow. After obtaining a can of diesel, it took two of us to hold the can up and pour it in, on the traffic-side of the van, with truckers blasting their horns at us as they sped by just a few feet away. I don't recommend this.

The second was just a few hours after the first. Closer to Calais, the unmistakable rumble of a flat came from the nearside rear. We pull over, and Jack, whose van we're in, removes the wheel and fits the spare in literally 3 minutes while the rest of us just kind of watch in awe of the speed. Despite the spare being a little under pressure, we still made our train.

The third was today. A major accident on the M1 led to it being closed entirely. After being stationary for a long time, the car wont start and I assume it's overheated. The recovery service is on the way, but stuck in the same traffic. Eventually the car starts without any intervention, but I meet the AA driver in a service area anyway for a diagnosis and he determines it's the battery.

This was a really unsatisfying outcome. Neither the overheat or battery really makes any sense when taking into account what happened. An overheat when it wasn't running? OK, that makes the battery seem more likely. But then why did it start without a jump later on? I don't have answers, just a set of ambiguous questions that will give a mechanic a good opportunity to charge a fortune for diagnosis.
