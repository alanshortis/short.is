Despite having taken 10 flights and countless train journeys since the start of COVID I have managed to avoid catching it. I put this down to not attending crowded indoor events, or even just busy pubs, as much as possible.

The streak might be over. I have some symptoms, but with LFT tests coming totally negative I need to find a PCR test and get confirmation.

I really do not want to catch COVID. The under-reported numbers on long COVID and what is still unknown about long-term issues worry me a little. Not enough to lock myself away, but enough to remain cautious. I'm comfortable with being the only mask wearer on public transport.
