I'm in an irritating position of being able to visualise something I want to make but not having the knowledge to realise it.

I know enough think I know that I need some trigonometry, but I can't even remember it being covered in school let alone know any of the mechanics of it.

There is an assumption that people who work in software engineering are good with mathematics, but for my specialty of front end development it's very rare I need to do anything beyond pretty basic arithmetic.

I love having learned something. I hate needing to learn something.
