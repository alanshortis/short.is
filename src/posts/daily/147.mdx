Lance Armstrong always said 'I have never failed a drug test' rather than just denying ever doping.

Nearly three years in and I think I need to stop saying that I have never had covid and switch to 'I have never tested positive for covid'.

My lungs are burning, I have a cough, and the sniffles. My home PCR test is negative but I'm not sure I believe it. I also can't quite fathom how it's even possible that I have avoided it since I have taken 12 flights, countless train and tube journeys, caught out in a busy IKEA since this all started. And all without being vastly careful, beyond a mask if the place is packed and keeping my hands clean.

Three covid events seems pretty normal among the people I know. So I've either had it never noticed anything until now, or I have super immunity.
