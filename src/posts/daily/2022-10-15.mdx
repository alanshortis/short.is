Cycling, then and now.

<h2 class="h4">2014–2019</h2>

- 1× 200+ mile ride
- 4× 175+ mile ride
- 60× 100+ mile ride
- 2× l'Etape du Tour
- 1× Etape Yorkshire
- 1× Flanders Sportive
- 21× HC classified climbs

<h2 class="h4">Today</h2>

- 27 miles eventually
- Stopped for a rest after 7
- Absolutely REKT when I got home
- Still feeling a bit weird now, 5 hours later

Something that correlates with these stats is my general mood and mental health. Then, I had a good memory, clear head, and felt motivated. Now, I can't remember anything, find it hard to think clearly a lot of the time, and it takes real effort to get anything done.

It's not all on me: a pandemic, lockdowns, and a rocky personal life have all led me where I am, but I know I can get back to where I was and beyond.
