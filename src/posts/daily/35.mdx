A book cull has left the ratio of books owned vs books read in an embarrassing place. Nice paper ornaments packaged with knowledge that's absent from my brain.

The [Penguin Great Ideas](https://www.penguin.co.uk/series/PEN02/penguin-great-ideas?page=1) series is a collection of beautifully designed non-fiction books, inexpensive enough to accumulate over time when I spot one in a shop that I don't yet have drawn in by the clean cover designs.

On an average day I write more words than a I read. Another ratio to be ashamed of.
