Food addiction is no joke. And when you're in a place where there is little joy to be had, those moments of anticipation before eating something delicious (not even the actual eating) become the highlight of the day.

From yesterday and today's writings, can you tell I'm not in a very good place? I'm not, but I have taken some small steps today to make improvements: Getting set up for better sleep, getting back into therapy, and getting back to things I loved in the past.

I'm really bored of feeling so lousy all the time, so I'm just not going to anymore.
