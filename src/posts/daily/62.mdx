I have 43 cycling routes planned that are currently a long way beyond my ability. Gravel climbs in Italy, huge distances across Scotland, massive elevation. At the time, none of these routes seemed out of the question and were planned with the intention to ride them all.

The pandemic and the resulting lockdowns led to such a huge drop in fitness and motivation, every one of these routes now seems totally insurmountable.
