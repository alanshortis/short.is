intro: "Whether you're starting a new job or buying your own hardware, it's pretty normal for a couple of years to pass between new machines and the set up required to start writing code. This is how I do it."
---

The first few hours after taking delivery of a new Mac could be spent trying to remember what apps I actually need, how exactly do I run JavaScript locally, and how did I make my terminal look so good AND so easy to use. Below, I run though my approach to getting things just so.

> There are some steps that could have unintended consequences. If you're unsure about anything listed below, stop and think before continuing. I accept no liability for any issues that could result from using this guide.

## macOS

Once you've started up your machine and logged in/set up the OS, the first thing you should do is check for any updates to the operating system. If there are some, install them.

If you use iCloud and didn't already sign in as part of the OS installation, sign in now. It'll get your files syncing nice and early, and if you're using two Macs it'll sync the clipboard so you can cut and paste between machines.

You don't need to dig around in system preferences to get everything just right. There are a series of commands you can run in the terminal, either one by one or condensed down to a shell script to set everything in one hit (though I prefer not to do this).

Open the default terminal and run each of these commands:

### Finder

```bash shell
# Set sidebar icon size to medium
defaults write NSGlobalDomain NSTableViewDefaultSizeMode -int 2

# Expand save panel by default

```

### Screenshots

```bash shell
# Save screenshots to {user}/Pictures instead of Desktop
defaults write com.apple.screencapture location -string "${HOME}/Pictures"

# Save screenshots in PNG format (other options: BMP, GIF, JPG, PDF, TIFF)
defaults write com.apple.screencapture type -string "png"

# Disable window shadow in screenshots
defaults write com.apple.screencapture disable-shadow -bool true
```

defaults write NSGlobalDomain AppleHighlightColor -string "0.780400 0.815700 0.858800"

# Disable "Ask Siri"
defaults write com.apple.assistant.support "Assistant Enabled" -bool false

defaults write com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent "Apple Initial Bitpool Min (editable)" 80
defaults write com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent "Negotiated Bitpool" 80
defaults write com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent "Negotiated Bitpool Max" 80
defaults write com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent "Negotiated Bitpool Min" 80
```

Nothing will take effect until the Finder and Dock have been killed. It's best to restart at this point.

If for some reason you want to see what any of these options are set to (probably useful if you already have your mouse tracking speed but you'd like to script it), you can replace `write` with `read` for any command. Though, something needs to have been set at some time to get a result:

```bash shell
defaults read -g com.apple.mouse.scaling
# '3'
```

## SSH key for source control permissions

If you're working with anything in GitHub that's private, either in a personal repo, an organisation, or in GitHub enterprise, you'll need to set up an SSH key so that you can push/pull with permission as seamlessly as possible.

First follow the steps in [Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent), then follow [Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

There are similar guides for [Bitbucket](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/set-up-an-ssh-key/#Step-3.-Add-the-public-key-to-your-Account-settings), [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/), and [Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/use-ssh-keys-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops).

If you've recently parted ways with a Mac make sure you delete keys from any services that had them.

## Installing apps

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a package manager for macOS, meaning you can install the apps you want (where available) from the command line. While it was originally for binaries and packages like Node, [Cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask) extends its powers to include desktop apps.

Open the terminal and paste this command to install Homebrew or copy the command from the Homebrew website if you'd prefer, following the prompts:

```bash shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Part of Homebrew's installation adds command line tools for Xcode, which saves us a step. It enables `git` and many other commands in the terminal, including `svn` if you use that particular flavour of source control.

Once this is done (it'll take a while), you can quickly verify that things are as they should be by running `brew` and `git`. Some helpful info and example commands should be shown if each command works.

It's a good idea to get [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed right away. It's the foundation of almost all front end development now, and will also install `npm` which we'll need to get some global packages and for setting up our terminal later:

```bash shell
# Install Node.js
# You can install a specific version: brew install node@14
brew install node
brew install nvm

# Check Node and NPM have installed if you like
node -v
npm -v

# Some packages that are worth having globally
npm i -g yarn
npm i -g lighthouse
npm i -g nodemon
npm i -g typescript
```

Before we can install all the desktop apps we want we need to extend what's available to us by installing a new 'tap', [homebrew-cask-versions](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask-versions):

```bash shell
brew tap homebrew/cask-versions
```

Time for our desktop apps:

```bash shell
# Browser
brew install --cask firefox-developer-edition

# Deveopment stuff
brew install --cask hyper
brew install --cask postman
brew install --cask visual-studio-code

# Design/visual stuff
brew install --cask adobe-creative-cloud
brew install --cask figma
brew install --cask imageoptim
brew install --cask vuescan

# Other stuff
brew install --cask slack
brew install --cask spotify
brew install --cask trainerroad
```

## A better terminal

So far we have done everything in the built-in terminal which is totally fine for running occasional commands. However, if you're a developer you're more than likely spending plenty of time in there so improving the user experience will make you much more efficient. We can add some features to help autocomplete commands, remember folders we've been to, and show some contextual information about git branches beside every command.

### Hyper

We already installed [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) using Homebrew, so let's set it up.

I like the [One Dark](https://hyper.is/store/hyper-one-dark) theme for everything, and like everything else in this guide we don't even need to leave the terminal to install this and a few other plugins:

```bash shell
# One Dark theme for Hyper
hyper i hyper-one-dark

# Adds searching with cmd+f
hyper i hyper-search

# Opens new tabs in the same directory as the current tab
hyper i hypercwd
```

There are plenty of other [plugins](https://hyper.is/plugins/newest) and [themes](https://hyper.is/themes/newest) to choose from.

### Oh My Zsh

macOS uses zsh by default now, but I like to use [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) as it comes with a lot of useful extras. Install it via the terminal, or copy the command from their website if you'd prefer:

```bash shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

It'll only take a few seconds to install, and once it's finished the command prompt will look a little different. Don't worry too much about that as we're going to make it look great soon.

### Aliases

Aliases are amazing. If you have long or complex commands that you need run frequently, like starting a server and a web application at the same time while moving between working directories, you can make a very short alias instead. You can also make aliases that are so small they almost seem pointless, but everyone likes a marginal gain.

To add your own, open `.zshrc` from your user folder (you'll need to open it from finder, and you will have needed to already have made hidden files visible) and at the bottom of the file there are some examples you can edit or replace.

I like to keep a separate `.aliases` file as I tinker with it pretty often. To do this, create that file in your user directory, then refer to it in `.zshrc` in place of the aliases already there:

```bash shell
[ -f .aliases ] && source .aliases
```

These are some of my aliases. It includes an alias to open my aliases. See if you can spot the ones added when I had a faulty keyboard on my 2016 MacBook Pro:

```bash shell
alias c="clear"
alias g="git"
alias gitt="git"
alias gittt="git"
alias gir="git"
alias aliases="cd ~ && code .aliases"
alias dev="npm run dev"
alias as="cd ~/Sites/short.is && npm run dev"
```

### z

[z](https://github.com/rupa/z) is a little extra magic. It keeps a record of all the directories you've visited in the past and takes you back there even if you only know a little bit of the folder name.

For example, if you visit a folder `~/Sites/design/design-system` pretty often, typing `z design` from ANY other location will take you directly to that folder. It's a huge time saver.

This isn't something we can magically install from the terminal, but it's still not very difficult. Download `z.sh` from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rupa/z) and save it as is in your user folder (the same place as your aliases and `.zshrc`). Next, open `.zshrc` again and add a reference to it at the bottom of the file:

```bash shell
# Include z
. ~/z.sh
zstyle ':completion:*' menu select
```

Quit Hyper and open it again to ensure the shell is restarted and all settings are loaded. To test that z working:

- From your user folder (`~`), make a new folder named 'Sites': `mkdir Sites`. This is where I like to keep all my web work.
- `cd Sites` to visit that folder.
- Go up one level: `..`.
- Type `z si` and hit enter. You should now be back in the 'Sites' directory.
- Try the same trick from any other folder, no matter how deeply nested, and you should get the same result.

I love this because I don't need to keep a mental model of what's where, I just need to know roughly what the directory is called.

### Auto suggestions

[zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions/) adds really clean suggestions to the command as you type. If you have ever previously typed `git reset --hard origin/main` (everyone has) it will show a greyed out suggestion to the right of the cursor. Hit tab, and it'll complete the line for you. This even works with things you've looked for with z for some combination special magic.

Install, or copy the command from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions/):

```bash shell
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
```

Then, add to the plugin list in `.zshrc`:

```bash shell
plugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions)
```

There are [a lot of plugins](https://github.com/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins) that you might like.

### Powerlevel10k

[Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) is a theme for zsh, but it's so much more than decoration. It adds some contextual information to the command prompt and generally makes the terminal a nicer place to spend time. If you ever used Powerlevel9k you'll know that it was a huge headache to set up, but this new version is a breeze.

First, we need to install a font so we have all the icons available that the theme uses. Download from [GitHub](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#meslo-nerd-font-patched-for-powerlevel10k), then open them all with Font Book and click install.

Open `.hyper.js` from your user directory and update this line. If you skip this, the theme won't render as expected as the icons will be missing:

```javascript
fontFamily: "MesloLGS NF",
```

Next, [install the theme itself](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#oh-my-zsh) and apply it:

```bash shell
# Download the theme
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ~/powerlevel10k

# Set the theme in .zshrc
echo 'source ~/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k.zsh-theme' >>~/.zshrc
```

Quit Hyper and open it again, and you'll be met with a configuration wizard. It'll ask you about what you want to see, so take your time getting it right. In the end, it'll write changes to `.zshrc` and create a new file called `.p10k.zsh` with all your options. It's pretty dense file, so I wouldn't go and edit it manually. If you want to make some changes you can run `p10k configure` to start the configuration wizard again.

That's the terminal all done. Looking good.

## Visual Studio Code

If you have a fresh install and no other Mac to work from, this is where things might get a little manual. The theme and font you choose might come down to taste, and the extensions you choose will depend on what you work on.

### Settings sync

If you do have another Mac (permanently or temporarily until you hand it back to a previous employer), Visual Studio Code includes [settings sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync) which lets you share all config and installed extensions across multiple machines. This is going to make set up as close to zero effort as possible.

The below steps are almost identical whether you're on the older Mac (that has the settings) and the newer Mac (that wants them):

- Open VS Code. From gear icon at the bottom left select 'Turn on Settings Sync...'.
- You'll be asked what you want to sync. I just choose everything, then click 'Sign in & Turn on'.
- Select either Microsoft or GitHub to sign in, depending on where it was saved previously. I use GitHub for this.
- After choosing GitHub, a browser window will open and ask you to authorize. Click continue (after checking you're where you expect to be of course). You'll probably need to login and handle 2FA etc.
- If you're on the older Mac, it'll push your settings up to GitHub and you won't notice any changes.
- If you're on the new Mac, you'll see things change pretty quickly, such as your chosen theme and extensions appearing.

Now, any changes made on either machine will appear on the other.

I like to keep a copy of my settings json file in GitHub, separate from the gist created by this plugin.

## Done

This is what works for me, and I'd always suggest making adjustments to include things you like, and exclude things you don't. As someone who has both a work and personal Mac (check your contract, because it might be that your company has a claim to ANYTHING you work on with their hardware), being able to automate and sync settings makes for a really consistent experience which ultimately makes me more efficient.

I'm sure I'll be updating this all again before long.
