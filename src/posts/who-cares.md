There is no American experience outside of the USA quite as accurate as visiting Costco. Before you even get into the store, the carpark has huge bays that are ideal for an F150 or Silverado. The shopping carts are almost big enough to need the same parking bays, making anyone pushing one look tiny.

That weird phenomenon in public bathrooms of the stalls having dividers too far off the ground, not really high enough, and with large gaps around the doors is here. It makes any privacy they provide more of an agreement not to look than something actually effective.

Finally, there is the no-nonsense signage. In the car park, it's 'Wrong Way' and never 'No Entry'. And you won't see a sign for the butcher; just head for the all-caps black-on-white that simply reads 'MEAT'.
